I'm studying LLMs. As part of my learning path, I'm going to create a custom tokenizer, trained using only the Portuguese language and BPE as the technique. I'm using Python, and I need your help. Before writing code for training, I need to know which Hugging Face datasets library to use, and I need to transform data in my input dataset: a column named "conversations" contains a list of dicts, each dict has "content" and "role". I want to extract all "content" values to a new column.

---

To train a custom Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer for Portuguese using Hugging Face's libraries, you'll need to work with the datasets library to handle and preprocess your data and the tokenizers library to train the tokenizer.

Below, I'll guide you through:

1. Selecting appropriate Portuguese datasets from Hugging Face
2. Transforming your conversational dataset for "content" extraction.

---

## Step 1: Selecting Portuguese Language Datasets

Hugging Face's datasets library provides access to a range of datasets, including several in Portuguese. Good options for BPE training:

1. **Wikipedia (Portuguese)**
   - **Dataset**: `wikipedia` (language: `pt`)
   - **Description**: Portuguese Wikipedia articles.
   - **Usage**: Large, varied vocabulary.
   - **Loading Example:**
      ```python
      from datasets import load_dataset
      wiki_dataset = load_dataset("wikipedia", "20220301.pt", split="train")
      ```

2. **OSCAR (Portuguese)**
   - **Dataset**: `oscar` (config: `unshuffled_deduplicated_pt`)
   - **Description**: Large multilingual web corpus; significant Portuguese subset.
   - **Usage**: Covers informal and formal Portuguese.
   - **Loading Example:**
      ```python
      from datasets import load_dataset
      oscar_dataset = load_dataset("oscar", "unshuffled_deduplicated_pt", split="train")
      ```

3. **Portuguese Web as Corpus (ptWaC)**
   - Not directly in datasets, but similar corpora (like OSCAR) are suitable.
   - **Description**: Web text, contemporary usage.
   - **Alternative**: Use OSCAR or scrape your own.

4. **Custom Conversational Datasets**
   - If your dataset is custom, for example as a JSON/CSV with a "conversations" column, you can load it like this:
      ```python
      from datasets import load_dataset
      custom_dataset = load_dataset("json", data_files="path/to/your/data.json", split="train")
      ```

**Recommendation:** Use Wikipedia or OSCAR due to their size and diversity. If you want to emphasize conversational Portuguese, use your custom dataset and/or supplement with OSCAR.

---

## Step 2: Transforming the Dataset

You have a column "conversations", which is a list of dicts like:
```python
{
  "conversations": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Olá, como você está?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Estou bem, obrigado! E você?"}
  ]
}
```

You want to create a new column (e.g., `"content_texts"`) containing just the "content" strings.

### Using Hugging Face datasets

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load your custom dataset
custom_dataset = load_dataset("json", data_files="path/to/your/data.json", split="train")

# Define a function to extract "content"
def extract_contents(example):
    # Get the list of dicts
    conversations = example["conversations"]
    # Extract the "content" from each dict in the list
    contents = [turn["content"] for turn in conversations]
    return {"content_texts": contents}

# Apply transformation
custom_dataset = custom_dataset.map(extract_contents)
```

Now, the dataset will have an additional column `"content_texts"` with only the text from each conversation turn.

---

**Summary:**

- Use Hugging Face's datasets library for data handling.
- Use OSCAR or Wikipedia (Portuguese) or your custom conversational data.
- Transform your dataset with `.map()` to extract "content" values for training your tokenizer.

Let me know if you need the full pipeline for BPE tokenizer training as well!

## Transformation Code

Here's a Python script to perform this transformation using the `datasets` library:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load your custom dataset (replace with your dataset path or name)
dataset = load_dataset(
    "json",
    data_files="path/to/your/data.json",
    split="train"
)

# Define a function to extract content from conversations
def extract_content(example):
    # Extract all "content" values from the "conversations" column
    content_texts = [conv["content"] for conv in example["conversations"] if "content" in conv]
    return {"content_texts": content_texts}

# Apply the transformation to create a new column
dataset = dataset.map(extract_content)

# Verify the new column
print(dataset[0])  # Check the first example
```

---

## Explanation

- **Loading the Dataset:**  
  The `load_dataset` function loads your data (e.g., from a JSON file). Replace `"path/to/your/data.json"` with the actual path or dataset name if it's on the Hugging Face Hub.

- **Mapping Function:**  
  The `extract_content` function uses a list comprehension to extract the "content" values from each dictionary in the "conversations" list.

- **Applying Transformation:**  
  The `dataset.map` method applies the `extract_content` function to each example in the dataset, adding the new "content_texts" column.

- **Output:**  
  The transformed dataset will include the original "conversations" column and the new "content_texts" column with the extracted content values.

---

## Handling Multiple Splits

If your dataset has multiple splits (e.g., train, validation, test), you can apply the transformation to all splits:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load dataset with multiple splits
dataset = load_dataset(
    "json",
    data_files={
        "train": "path/to/train.json",
        "validation": "path/to/validation.json",
        "test": "path/to/test.json"
    }
)

# Define the transformation function
def extract_content(example):
    content_texts = [conv["content"] for conv in example["conversations"] if "content" in conv]
    return {"content_texts": content_texts}

# Apply transformation to all splits
dataset = dataset.map(extract_content, batched=False)

# Verify
print(dataset["train"][0])
```

---

## Step 3: Preparing Data for Tokenizer Training

To train a BPE tokenizer, you need plain text data. After extracting the "content_texts" column, you can use it as input for the tokenizer. The `tokenizers` library expects either text files or an iterator of text strings. Here's how you can prepare the data:

### Option 1: Save to Text Files

If you prefer to save the content texts to files for training:

```python
import os

# Create a directory to store text files
os.makedirs("text_data", exist_ok=True)

# Save content texts to a file
with open("text_data/conversations.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    for example in dataset:
        for content in example["content_texts"]:
            f.write(content + "\n")
```
This creates a text file (`conversations.txt`) where each line is a "content" string, ready for tokenizer training.

---

### Option 2: Use an Iterator

Alternatively, you can create an iterator to feed the content texts directly to the tokenizer:

```python
def content_iterator(dataset):
    for example in dataset:
        for content in example["content_texts"]:
            yield content
```

---

## Step 4: Training the BPE Tokenizer

Here's a basic example of how to train a BPE tokenizer using the `tokenizers` library with the prepared data:

```python
from tokenizers import Tokenizer, models, pre_tokenizers, trainers

# Initialize a BPE tokenizer
tokenizer = Tokenizer(models.BPE(unk_token="[UNK]"))

# Set a pre-tokenizer (e.g., split on whitespace)
tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()

# Define the trainer with special tokens
trainer = trainers.BpeTrainer(
    vocab_size=30000,  # Adjust based on your needs
    special_tokens=["[UNK]", "[CLS]", "[SEP]", "[PAD]", "[MASK]"],
    min_frequency=2
)

# Train the tokenizer using the iterator
tokenizer.train_from_iterator(content_iterator(dataset), trainer=trainer)

# Save the tokenizer
tokenizer.save("portuguese_bpe_tokenizer.json")
```

---

## Notes

- **Vocab Size:**  
  Choose a vocabulary size (e.g., 30,000) based on your dataset size and requirements. Larger datasets can support larger vocabularies.

- **Special Tokens:**  
  Include tokens like `[UNK]`, `[CLS]`, `[SEP]`, `[PAD]`, and `[MASK]` if you plan to use the tokenizer with models like BERT or RoBERTa.

- **Pre-tokenizer:**  
  The `Whitespace` pre-tokenizer is usually sufficient for many languages, but you can experiment with others depending on your needs.

---

If you need further steps or customization, let me know!

Here is your conversation, cleaned up and formatted in Markdown, focusing on content only:

---

## Pre-tokenizer

The **Whitespace** pre-tokenizer splits text into words based on spaces, which is suitable for BPE. You can explore other pre-tokenizers if needed.

---

## Step 5: Using the Tokenizer

Once trained, you can load the tokenizer and use it with Hugging Face’s `transformers` library:

```python
from transformers import PreTrainedTokenizerFast

# Load the trained tokenizer
fast_tokenizer = PreTrainedTokenizerFast(tokenizer_file="portuguese_bpe_tokenizer.json")

# Test the tokenizer
encoded = fast_tokenizer(
    "Olá, como você está?",
    padding=True,
    truncation=True,
    return_tensors="pt"
)

print(encoded)
```

---

## Additional Tips

- **Dataset Size**: For a robust tokenizer, use a large and diverse dataset. Combining Wikipedia and OSCAR with your conversational dataset can improve coverage.

- **Preprocessing**: Ensure your text is clean (e.g., remove special characters or normalize text if needed) before training.

- **Validation**: After training, test the tokenizer on sample Portuguese text to ensure it tokenizes effectively without excessive `[UNK]` tokens.

- **Hugging Face Hub**: If you want to share your tokenizer, you can push it to the Hugging Face Hub using  
  `tokenizer.push_to_hub("your-username/portuguese-bpe-tokenizer")`.

### Question

I'm following a sample code and it gets a sample from original data to run using:

```python
dataset = dataset.shuffle(seed=args.seed).select(range(args.num_samples))
```

I tried to do the same and got the error:

```
AttributeError: 'DatasetDict' object has no attribute 'select'
```

How can I sample my dataset?

---

Here is the conversation converted into Markdown:

---

The error 

`AttributeError: 'DatasetDict' object has no attribute 'select'`

occurs because you're trying to apply the `select` method on a `DatasetDict` object, but `select` is a method available on a `Dataset` object, not a `DatasetDict`. A `DatasetDict` is a dictionary-like structure that contains multiple splits (e.g., `train`, `validation`, `test`), while a `Dataset` is the actual dataset for a specific split.

To sample your dataset, you need to apply the `shuffle` and `select` operations on a specific split of the `DatasetDict`, such as `dataset["train"]`. Below, I'll explain how to fix this and sample your dataset correctly.

---

### Understanding the Issue

Your dataset is likely a `DatasetDict` because you loaded it with multiple splits, as shown in your previous code:

```python
dataset = load_dataset(
    "json", 
    data_files={
        "train": "path/to/train.json",
        "validation": "path/to/validation.json",
        "test": "path/to/test.json"
    }
)
```

This creates a `DatasetDict` with keys like `"train"`, `"validation"`, and `"test"`, where each value is a `Dataset` object. The `shuffle` and `select` methods must be applied to one of these `Dataset` objects, not the entire `DatasetDict`.

---

### Solution: Sampling a Specific Split

To sample a subset of your dataset (e.g., `args.num_samples` examples) from a specific split, you need to access the split first. Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load your dataset (example with multiple splits)
dataset = load_dataset(
    "json", 
    data_files={
        "train": "path/to/train.json",
        "validation": "path/to/validation.json",
        "test": "path/to/test.json"
    }
)

# Define your arguments (replace with your actual values)
class Args:
    seed = 42
    num_samples = 1000  # Number of samples to select

args = Args()

# Sample from the 'train' split
train_dataset = dataset["train"].shuffle(seed=args.seed).select(range(args.num_samples))

# Optionally, update the DatasetDict with the sampled split
dataset["train"] = train_dataset

# Verify the sampled dataset
print(f"Sampled dataset size: {len(dataset['train'])}")
print(dataset["train"][0])
```

---

### Explanation

1. **Access the Split**: `dataset["train"]` retrieves the `Dataset` object for the `"train"` split, which supports methods like `shuffle` and `select`.
2. **Shuffle**: The `shuffle(seed=args.seed)` method randomizes the order of examples in the dataset, using the specified seed for reproducibility.
3. **Select**: The `select(range(args.num_samples))` method selects the first `args.num_samples` examples from the shuffled dataset. Ensure `args.num_samples` is less than or equal to the size of the dataset to avoid an out-of-range error.
4. **Update Dataset**: If you want to keep the `DatasetDict` structure, you can assign the sampled dataset back to `dataset["train"]`.

---

### Sampling Multiple Splits

If you want to sample from multiple splits (e.g., `train`, `validation`, `test`), you can apply the same logic to each split:

```python
# Sample from all splits
for split in dataset.keys():
    if len(dataset[split]) >= args.num_samples:  # Ensure enough samples
        dataset[split] = dataset[split].shuffle(seed=args.seed).select(range(args.num_samples))
    else:
        print(f"Warning: {split} split has fewer samples ({len(dataset[split])}) than requested ({args.num_samples}). Using all available samples.")
        dataset[split] = dataset[split].shuffle(seed=args.seed)

# Verify
```

---

If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

Here is your content converted to Markdown. HTML/CSS styling and positioning are ignored, and only the plain information and code are retained.

---

This code checks if each split has enough samples and applies sampling only if feasible, otherwise it uses all available samples.

## Handling Single-Split Datasets

If your dataset is a single `Dataset` object (e.g., loaded with `split="train"`), the original code should work without modification:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load a single split
dataset = load_dataset("json", data_files="path/to/train.json", split="train")

# Sample
dataset = dataset.shuffle(seed=args.seed).select(range(args.num_samples))

# Verify
print(f"Sampled dataset size: {len(dataset)}")
```

## Error Prevention

- **Check Dataset Type**: Verify whether your dataset is a `Dataset` or `DatasetDict` using `print(type(dataset))`. If it's a `DatasetDict`, access the appropriate split.
- **Sample Size**: Ensure `args.num_samples` does not exceed the size of the dataset split. You can check the size with `len(dataset["train"])` or `len(dataset)` for a single `Dataset`.
- **Seed**: The `seed` parameter ensures reproducibility. Use the same seed for consistent results across runs.

## Example with Your Previous Code

Since you're working with a dataset that has a "conversations" column and you've transformed it to add a "content_texts" column, here's how you can integrate sampling with that workflow:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Define arguments
class Args:
    seed = 42
    num_samples = 1000

args = Args()

# Load dataset
dataset = load_dataset(
    "json",
    data_files={
        "train": "path/to/train.json",
        "validation": "path/to/validation.json",
        "test": "path/to/test.json"
    }
)

# Transform to extract content_texts
def extract_content(example):
    content_texts = [conv["content"] for conv in example["conversations"] if "content" in conv]
    return {"content_texts": content_texts}

dataset = dataset.map(extract_content)

# Sample the train split
if len(dataset["train"]) >= args.num_samples:
    dataset["train"] = dataset["train"].shuffle(seed=args.seed).select(range(args.num_samples))
else:
    print(f"Warning: Train split has only {len(dataset['train'])} samples.")
    dataset["train"] = dataset["train"].shuffle(seed=args.seed)

# Verify
print(dataset["train"][0])
```

## Notes

- **Dataset Size**: If your dataset is large, sampling is useful to reduce training time for the tokenizer. For small datasets, you might not need sampling.
- **Hugging Face Documentation**: Refer to the [datasets documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.14.4/en/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Dataset.shuffle) for more details on `shuffle` and [select](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.14.4/en/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Dataset.select).
- **Next Steps**: Once sampled, you can use the `content_texts` column to train your BPE tokenizer, as shown in your previous question.

If you encounter further errors or need help with a specific part of the process (e.g., debugging the dataset structure, handling large datasets, or proceeding with tokenizer training), please provide more details, and I'll assist further!

---

cool, error fixed. Now, I'm going to proceed to train the tokenizer, does the trainers.BpeTrainer run on GPU or CPU only? can I run it in parallel?

---

Great to hear you fixed the error! Let's address your questions about training the BPE tokenizer using `trainers.BpeTrainer` from Hugging Face's `tokenizers` library, specifically whether it runs on GPU or CPU and whether it can be run in parallel.

---

### Does `trainers.BpeTrainer` Run on GPU or CPU?



## Run on GPU or CPU?

The `trainers.BpeTrainer` from the Hugging Face `tokenizers` library runs **exclusively on CPU**. Here’s why:

- **Implementation Details**: The `tokenizers` library is built on Rust and designed for high-performance tokenization tasks. The BPE training process involves iterative merging of token pairs based on frequency, which is computationally intensive but sequential. The library does not leverage GPU acceleration for training, as the operations (such as counting token pairs and merging vocabularies) are not well-suited for GPU parallelization compared to neural network training.
- **Performance**: Despite running on CPU, the `tokenizers` library is highly optimized and typically fast for most datasets. The training speed depends on the dataset size, vocabulary size, and CPU performance.

## Can `trainers.BpeTrainer` Run in Parallel?

By default, the `trainers.BpeTrainer` **does not run in parallel** (does not use multiple CPU cores or threads). However, there are some nuances:

- **Single-Threaded by Default**: The BPE training algorithm in `tokenizers` is implemented as a single-threaded process. It processes the corpus sequentially to build the vocabulary by counting token pair frequencies and performing merges iteratively. The library does not natively support parallel processing for a single tokenizer training run.
- **Parallelization Possibilities**:
  - **Manual Parallelization**: If you have a very large dataset, you can split your dataset into chunks, train separate tokenizers on each chunk, and merge vocabularies manually. This is complex and not natively supported by `trainers.BpeTrainer`. Merging vocabularies from multiple BPE trainers can introduce inconsistencies and is not generally recommended.
  - **Preprocessing in Parallel**: The [`datasets`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/process) library (used for loading & preprocessing your data) supports parallel processing for operations like `map` when preparing your dataset (e.g., extracting `content_texts`). You can enable parallel processing with the `num_proc` parameter, for example:

    ```python
    dataset = dataset.map(extract_content, num_proc=4)  # Use 4 CPU cores
    ```

    This speeds up preprocessing (e.g., extracting `content_texts` from the `conversations` column) before feeding the data to the tokenizer.

- **Limitations**: The actual BPE training step—`trainer.train_from_iterator` or `trainer.train`—does not support parallelization within the `tokenizers` library. Attempting manual parallelization requires careful post-processing to combine results.

## Practical Recommendations

1. **Optimize for CPU**
   - Since `trainers.BpeTrainer` runs on CPU, use a machine with a powerful CPU and enough memory, especially for large datasets.
   - For very large datasets, consider sampling a subset (as with `.shuffle().select()`) to reduce training time while capturing a representative vocabulary.

2. **Preprocessing in Parallel**
   - Use the `num_proc` parameter in `dataset.map` to parallelize data preprocessing:

     ```python
     from datasets import load_dataset

     # Load and preprocess dataset
     dataset = load_dataset("json", data_files={"train": "path/to/train.json"}, split="train")

     def extract_content(example):
         return {"content_texts": [conv["content"] for conv in example["conversations"] if "content" in conv]}

     dataset = dataset.map(extract_content, num_proc=4)  # Parallel preprocessing with 4 cores
     ```

   - This can significantly speed up preparation of `content_texts` for tokenizer training.

3. **Training the Tokenizer**

   Here’s a sample code snippet for training the BPE tokenizer (incorporating your sampled dataset):

   ```python
   from tokenizers import Tokenizer, models, pre_tokenizers, trainers

   # Sample dataset
   args = {"seed": 42, "num_samples": 1000}
   train_dataset = dataset.shuffle(seed=args["seed"]).select(range(args["num_samples"]))

   # Create iterator for content_texts
   def content_iterator(dataset):
       for example in dataset:
           for content in example["content_texts"]:
               yield content

   # Initialize tokenizer
   tokenizer = Tokenizer(models.BPE(unk_token="[UNK]"))
   tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()

   # Define trainer
   trainer = trainers.BpeTrainer(
       vocab_size=30000,
       special_tokens=["[UNK]", "[CLS]", "[SEP]", "[PAD]", "[MASK]"],
       min_frequency=2
   )

   # Train tokenizer
   tokenizer.train_from_iterator(content_iterator(train_dataset), trainer=trainer)

   # Save tokenizer
   tokenizer.save("portuguese_bpe_tokenizer.json")
   ```

   This code runs on CPU and processes the dataset sequentially. Make sure your dataset fits in memory or use a smaller sample.

4. **Scaling for Large Datasets**

   If your dataset is too large and training is slow, consider:
   - **Reducing `vocab_size`**: A smaller vocabulary (e.g., 10,000 instead of 30,000) speeds up training but may affect quality.
   - **Sampling**: You’ve already sampled `args.num_samples`. Experiment with different sample sizes.
   - **Batching**: While `trainers.BpeTrainer` doesn't support batching natively, you can batch input data manually, though this won’t parallelize the training itself.

5. **Monitoring Performance**

   Use a tool like [`tqdm`](https://tqdm.github.io/) to monitor training progress if you want visibility into runtime.

---

**Summary**:  
- Hugging Face `tokenizers` training runs only on CPU.
- BPE training is single-threaded; preprocessing can be parallelized with `datasets` library (`num_proc`).
- For best performance, optimize CPU and sample datasets.
- No native GPU or parallel CPU support for BPE training; large datasets should be processed in subsets and preprocessed in parallel.

Here is your content converted to Markdown:

---

```python
from tqdm import tqdm

def content_iterator_with_progress(dataset):
    for example in tqdm(dataset, desc="Processing examples"):
        for content in example["content_texts"]:
            yield content

tokenizer.train_from_iterator(content_iterator_with_progress(train_dataset), trainer=trainer)
```

---

## Key Notes

- **No GPU Support:**  
  `trainers.BpeTrainer` is CPU-only, so you don't need a GPU for this task. A modern multi-core CPU is sufficient for most datasets.

- **Parallelization Limited:**  
  The training process is single-threaded, but you can parallelize preprocessing steps using `datasets`. Manual parallelization of BPE training is complex and not recommended.

- **Performance Tips:**
  - Use a smaller sample of your dataset for initial testing to ensure the pipeline works.
  - If training is too slow, check the size of your dataset with `len(dataset)` and consider reducing `num_samples` or `vocab_size`.
  - Ensure your machine has enough RAM to handle the dataset and vocabulary during training.

### Explain me this part of code:

```python
# Initialize tokenizer
tokenizer = Tokenizer(models.BPE(unk_token="[UNK]"))
tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()
```

Let's break down the provided code snippet, which initializes a tokenizer using the Hugging Face `tokenizers` library and configures it for Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) with a specific pre-tokenizer:

---

#### Line 1:
```python
tokenizer = Tokenizer(models.BPE(unk_token="[UNK]"))
```

This line creates a new tokenizer object and configures it to use the BPE algorithm.

- `Tokenizer`: This is a class from the Hugging Face `tokenizers` library that serves as the main interface for building and managing a tokenizer. It encapsulates the tokenization pipeline, including the model (e.g., BPE), pre-tokenization, and post-processing steps.
- `models.BPE`: This specifies the tokenization algorithm to be used, in this case, Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE). BPE is a subword tokenization algorithm that iteratively merges the most frequent pairs of characters or subwords in the training corpus to build a vocabulary. It balances between word-level and character-level tokenization, making it effective for handling diverse languages like Portuguese.
- `unk_token="[UNK]"`: This parameter defines the "unknown" token, which is used during tokenization to represent any word or subword not found in the tokenizer's vocabulary. For example, if the tokenizer encounters a rare word or a typo (e.g., "qwerty") after training, it will map it to `[UNK]`. The `[UNK]` token is a standard convention in many NLP models, ensuring the tokenizer can handle out-of-vocabulary tokens gracefully.

**What This Line Does:**  
It initializes a `Tokenizer` object with a BPE model, setting `[UNK]` as the special token for unknown words. At this point, the tokenizer is empty (no vocabulary yet) and needs to be trained on your dataset to learn the vocabulary.

---

#### Line 2:
```python
tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()
```

This line configures the pre-tokenization step, which determines how the input text is split into initial tokens before the BPE algorithm processes them.

- `pre_tokenizer`: In the Hugging Face `tokenizers` library, pre-tokenization is the first step in the tokenization pipeline. It splits raw text into smaller units (e.g., words or subwords) that the BPE model will further process. Pre-tokenization is crucial because it defines the initial granularity of the tokens that BPE will merge.
- `pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()`: This is a specific pre-tokenizer that splits text based on whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines). For example, the sentence `"Olá, como você está?"` would be split into the tokens `["Olá,", "como", "você", "está?"]`. Each of these tokens is then fed into the BPE algorithm, which may further split or merge them based on the training process.

**What This Line Does:**  
It sets the tokenizer to use whitespace-based splitting as the first step in processing text. This is a common choice for BPE tokenizers because it provides a natural starting point (words or word-like units) for the BPE algorithm to learn subword units.

---

#### Why These Choices?

- **BPE Model:**  
  BPE is a good choice for Portuguese because it can handle the language's morphology (e.g., verb conjugations, compound words) by learning subword units like prefixes ("des-") or suffixes ("-ção"). It also manages rare words effectively by breaking them into known subword pieces.
- **Whitespace Pre-Tokenizer:**  
  Using `pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()` is suitable for most languages, including Portuguese, because it aligns with natural word boundaries. It ensures that the BPE algorithm starts with meaningful units (words or punctuation) rather than raw characters, which can improve efficiency and vocabulary quality.

---

#### Example of How It Works

Let's walk through how these settings affect tokenization, assuming you train the tokenizer later:

1. **Input Text:**  
   `"Olá, como você está?"`
2. **Pre-Tokenization (Whitespace):**  
   The `Whitespace` pre-tokenizer splits the text into:
   ```python
   ["Olá,", "como", "você", "está?"]
   ```
   Each of these tokens is then processed by the BPE algorithm.

---

If you need any further examples, let me know!

Here is your conversation, converted to clean Markdown:

---

```
["Olá,", "como", "você", "está?"]
```

---

### BPE Processing (After Training)

During training, the BPE algorithm learns frequent subword units from your Portuguese dataset. For example, it might learn that `"você"` is a common word and keep it as a single token, or it might split `"está?"` into `["est", "á", "?"]` if those subword units are frequent. The exact splits depend on the trained vocabulary.

---

### Unknown Tokens

If the tokenizer encounters a word not in its vocabulary (e.g., a rare word like `"xablau"`), it will either break it into smaller known subword units (e.g., `"xa"`, `"blau"`) or replace it with `[UNK]` if no known subwords match.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Alternative Pre-Tokenizers**: While `Whitespace` is a common choice, you could explore other pre-tokenizers, such as:
  - `pre_tokenizers.ByteLevel()`: Splits text at the byte level, which is useful for handling special characters or multilingual text but may produce smaller initial tokens.
  - `pre_tokenizers.Punctuation()`: Treats punctuation as separate tokens, which might be useful if you want finer control over punctuation handling in Portuguese.
  - You can combine pre-tokenizers using `pre_tokenizers.Sequence` if needed (e.g., `pre_tokenizers.Sequence([pre_tokenizers.Whitespace(), pre_tokenizers.Punctuation()])`).

- **Special Tokens**: The `unk_token="[UNK]"` is just one of several special tokens you might use. In your previous code, you included `["[UNK]", "[CLS]", "[SEP]", "[PAD]", "[MASK]"]` in the trainer, which are typical for models like BERT. The `unk_token` is the only one specified in the BPE model initialization, but others are added during training via the `BpeTrainer`.

- **Impact on Training**: The choice of pre-tokenizer affects the training process. `Whitespace` ensures that BPE starts with word-like units, which is efficient for languages like Portuguese with clear word boundaries. If you used a character-level pre-tokenizer, training might take longer and produce a different vocabulary.

---

## Context in Your Project

Since you're building a Portuguese BPE tokenizer, this code sets up the foundation for training. The `Whitespace` pre-tokenizer is a good choice for your conversational dataset (with the `content_texts` column), as it aligns with natural language boundaries in Portuguese. After this initialization, you'll train the tokenizer on your dataset (e.g., using `content_iterator` and `trainers.BpeTrainer`), as shown in your previous code.

---

## Full Example for Clarity

Here's how this code fits into the broader tokenizer training pipeline:

```python
from tokenizers import Tokenizer, models, pre_tokenizers, trainers
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load and preprocess dataset
dataset = load_dataset(
    "json",
    data_files={"train": "path/to/train.json"},
    split="train"
)

def extract_content(example):
    return {"content_texts": [conv["content"] for conv in example["conversations"] if "content" in conv]}
dataset = dataset.map(extract_content)

# Sample dataset
args = {"seed": 42, "num_samples": 1000}
dataset = dataset.shuffle(seed=args["seed"]).select(range(args["num_samples"]))

# Initialize tokenizer
tokenizer = Tokenizer(models.BPE(unk_token="[UNK]"))
tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()

# Define iterator
def content_iterator(dataset):
    for example in dataset:
        for content in example["content_texts"]:
            yield content

# Train tokenizer
trainer = trainers.BpeTrainer(
    vocab_size=30000,
    special_tokens=["[UNK]", "[CLS]", "[SEP]", "[PAD]", "[MASK]"],
    min_frequency=2
)
tokenizer.train_from_iterator(content_iterator(dataset), trainer=trainer)

# Save tokenizer
tokenizer.save("portuguese_bpe_tokenizer.json")
```

### User Question

> why is it important to set the unknown tokenizer? I don't see it in other examples and as all single letter should be a token the lack of a token for a specific word shouldn't be a problem

---

### Assistant Response

Your question about the importance of setting the unknown token (`unk_token="[UNK]"`) in the BPE tokenizer and why it might not be necessary given that single letters are tokens is insightful. Let's break it down to clarify the role of the unknown token, why it's typically included, and whether it's strictly necessary in the context of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) for your Portuguese tokenizer project.

#### What is the Unknown Token (`[UNK]`)?

The unknown token (`[UNK]`) is a special token used by a tokenizer to represent any word, subword, or character in the input text that is not present in the tokenizer's vocabulary. When the tokenizer processes text and encounters something it hasn't learned during training, it replaces that sequence with `[UNK]`. This ensures the tokenizer can handle any input without failing, even if it contains rare words, misspellings, or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms.

For example, if your tokenizer's vocabulary doesn't include the word `"xablau"`, ...

*(Content continues with more explanation as per original answer)*

---

(If you want more explanation here, just specify!)

**"xablau"** (a rare or made-up Portuguese word), the tokenizer might:

- Break it into smaller known subwords (e.g., **"xa"**, **"blau"**) if those are in the vocabulary.
- Replace it entirely with **[UNK]** if no subword pieces match.

---

## Why Set the Unknown Token?

Setting the `unk_token` explicitly (e.g., `unk_token="[UNK]"`) when initializing a BPE tokenizer is important for several reasons, particularly in the context of downstream NLP tasks:

1. **Handling Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) Words**:
   - Even with BPE, which builds a vocabulary of subword units (including single letters in the initial stages), there may be cases where the tokenizer cannot represent a piece of text using its vocabulary. For instance:
     - Special characters, emojis, or symbols not seen during training (e.g., 😊 or §).
     - Words in other languages or dialects not present in your Portuguese dataset.
     - Typos or rare terms that weren't frequent enough to be included in the vocabulary.
   - The **[UNK]** token ensures the tokenizer can still process these cases by mapping them to a single, predictable token.

2. **Compatibility with NLP Models**:
   - Many NLP models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, or other transformer-based models) expect an **[UNK]** token in the vocabulary to handle OOV inputs. If you plan to use your tokenizer with such models, setting the `unk_token` ensures compatibility.
   - During model training or inference, **[UNK]** tokens allow the model to learn how to handle unknown inputs, often by treating them as a neutral or low-information token.

3. **Robustness in Real-World Applications**:
   - In production systems, input text can be unpredictable (e.g., user-generated content, noisy data). The **[UNK]** token provides a fallback mechanism to ensure the tokenizer doesn't crash or produce invalid outputs.
   - For example, if a user inputs **"qwerty123"** and none of the subword units match your vocabulary, the tokenizer will output **[UNK]** instead of failing.

4. **Standard Practice**:
   - Including an **[UNK]** token is a standard convention in NLP tokenizers, especially for models trained with Hugging Face's `transformers` library. It ensures consistency when loading the tokenizer into frameworks like `PreTrainedTokenizerFast`, which expects special tokens like **[UNK]**, **[CLS]**, **[SEP]**, etc.

---

## Why You Might Think It's Unnecessary

Your observation that single letters are tokens in BPE and that the lack of a specific word shouldn't be a problem is correct to an extent, but there are nuances:

- **BPE and Single Letters**: In BPE, the initial vocabulary includes all individual characters (or bytes, depending on the pre-tokenizer) in the training corpus. As the algorithm merges frequent pairs, it builds subword units, but single characters remain in the vocabulary. This means that, theoretically, any input text can be tokenized into at least single-character tokens, reducing the likelihood of needing **[UNK]**. For example:
  - If **"xablau"** isn't in the vocabulary, BPE might tokenize it as `["x", "a", "b", "l", "a", "u"]` or some combination of subwords (e.g., `["xa", "blau"]`) if those units were learned.
  - However, this assumes the input only contains characters seen during training. If the input includes unseen characters (e.g., a rare Unicode symbol or a character from another script), BPE cannot tokenize it without an **[UNK]** token.
  
- **Vocabulary Size Constraints**: BPE training is constrained by the `vocab_size` parameter (e.g., 30,000 in your code). Rare subwords or characters may not make it into the final vocabulary if they don't meet the `min_frequency` threshold or if the vocabulary size is too small. In such cases, the **[UNK]** token is needed for any sequence that cannot be represented.

- **Pre-Tokenizer Impact**: Your code uses `pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()`, which splits text into word-like units before BPE processing. If a pre-tokenized word contains characters or subwords not in the vocabulary, the tokenizer may resort to **[UNK]** unless it can break it down further. For example:
  - Input: **"Olá, xablau!"**
  - Pre-tokenized: `["Olá,", "xablau!"]`
  - If **"xablau!"** or its subwords aren't in the vocabulary, it might be replaced with **[UNK]**.

---

## Why Some Examples Omit `unk_token`?

You mentioned not seeing the `unk_token` in other examples. This could happen for a few reasons:

1. **Default Behavior**:
   - The `tokenizers` library can function without an explicitly set `unk_token`. If not specified, the tokenizer may:
     - Fall back to character-level tokenization for unknown sequences, as BPE includes single characters in its initial vocabulary.
     - Skip adding an **[UNK]** token, which might work for simple use cases but cause issues with downstream models expecting an **[UNK]** token.
     - In such cases, the tokenizer might not handle OOV cases gracefully, leading to unexpected behavior (e.g., skipping tokens or raising errors).

2. **Simplified Examples**:
   - Some tutorials or examples focus on the minimal setup for training a tokenizer and omit special tokens like **[UNK]** to keep the code concise. These examples might assume the tokenizer is for experimentation or that the dataset is clean and fully covered by the vocabulary.

3. **Byte-Level BPE**:
   - Some tokenizers (e.g., GPT-2's byte-level BPE) use a byte-level pre-tokenizer, which ensures every possible input (even unseen characters) can be represented as byte sequences. In such cases, an **[UNK]** token is less critical because the tokenizer can always fall back to byte-level tokens. However, your code uses `pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()`, not a byte-level pre-tokenizer, so **[UNK]** remains relevant.

4. **Custom Use Cases**:
   - If the tokenizer is used in a context where OOV words are rare or irrelevant (e.g., a controlled dataset with no unseen characters), the developer might skip setting an **[UNK]** token. However, this is risky for general-purpose applications.

---

## Should You Include `unk_token`?

Yes, you should include the `unk_token` in your BPE tokenizer for the following reasons:

- **Future-Proofing**: Even if your current Portuguese dataset is clean and comprehensive, real-world inputs may contain unexpected tokens (e.g., emojis, foreign words, or typos). The **[UNK]** token ensures robustness.
- **Model Compatibility**: If you plan to use your tokenizer with a model (e.g., fine-tuning a transformer like BERT for Portuguese), the model will expect an **[UNK]** token in the vocabulary. Omitting it could cause errors or require additional preprocessing.
- **Consistency**: Including **[UNK]** aligns with best practices and makes your tokenizer compatible with Hugging Face's `transformers` library, especially when using `PreTrainedTokenizerFast`.

If you choose not to include `unk_token`:
- The tokenizer might still work for your dataset, especially since BPE includes single characters, but it could fail on unseen characters or require custom handling for OOV cases.
- You might face issues when integrating with models or frameworks that expect an **[UNK]** token.

---

## Example of [UNK] in Action

Here's how the `unk_token` might be used after training your tokenizer:

```python
# Assume you have trained your tokenizer
from tokenizers import Tokenizer

tokenizer = Tokenizer.from_file("your-bpe-tokenizer.json")

tokens = tokenizer.encode("Olá, 😊 xablau!")

print(tokens.tokens)  # Output might be: ['Olá', ',', '[UNK]', 'xablau', '!']
```

- In this example, the emoji 😊 or a very rare/unseen word could be mapped to `[UNK]` if it's not in your vocabulary.

---

**Summary:**  
Even if you don't encounter OOV tokens in your controlled data, best practice is to include an `unk_token` for real-world robustness, model compatibility, and future use cases.

Here is your content converted from HTML to Markdown, focusing only on structure and meaning (ignoring all styling):

---

```python
from tokenizers import Tokenizer

# Load your trained tokenizer
tokenizer = Tokenizer.from_file("portuguese_bpe_tokenizer.json")

# Test with a known and unknown word
text = "Olá xablau!"
encoded = tokenizer.encode(text)

print(encoded.tokens)  # Example output: ['Olá', '[UNK]'] if 'xablau' is unknown
```

Without `unk_token`, the tokenizer might:

- Break `"xablau"` into single characters (e.g., `['x', 'a', 'b', 'l', 'a', 'u']`), which could bloat the input sequence.
- Fail or skip the unknown word, leading to incomplete tokenization.

---

### Your Specific Case

Since you're training a BPE tokenizer for Portuguese with `pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()` and a sampled dataset, including `unk_token="[UNK]"` is a safe choice. It ensures:

- Your tokenizer can handle rare or unseen words in conversational Portuguese (e.g., slang, typos, or foreign terms).
- Compatibility with downstream tasks, such as fine-tuning a language model.
- Robustness for real-world applications where inputs may not match the training data.

---

### Recommendations

1. **Keep the `unk_token`:**  
   Continue using `unk_token="[UNK]"` as in your code. It adds minimal overhead and ensures robustness.
2. **Test for `[UNK]` Usage:**  
   After training, test your tokenizer on text with rare or out-of-vocabulary words to see how often `[UNK]` appears. If it appears too frequently, you might need to:
   - Increase `vocab_size` to capture more subwords.
   - Include more diverse data in training to cover rare terms.
3. **Check Vocabulary Coverage:**  
   Use the trained tokenizer to encode a sample of your dataset and check the proportion of `[UNK]` tokens. A low proportion indicates good vocabulary coverage.
4. **Consider Byte-Level BPE:**  
   If you want to minimize reliance on `[UNK]`, you could switch to `pre_tokenizers.ByteLevel()`, which ensures all inputs can be tokenized at the byte level. However, this might increase training time and change the tokenization behavior.

---

### Example with Your Code

Your current setup is robust:

```python
tokenizer = Tokenizer(models.BPE(unk_token="[UNK]"))
tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()
```

To verify the role of `[UNK]`, you can train and test the tokenizer:

```python
# After training
tokenizer = Tokenizer.from_file("portuguese_bpe_tokenizer.json")
text = "Olá, xablau e qwerty!"  # Includes rare/made-up words
encoded = tokenizer.encode(text)
print(encoded.tokens)  # Check if 'xablau' or 'qwerty' become '[UNK]'
```

---

**Question:**  
I could also initialize a tokenizer based on an existing one, gpt2 as example, right? how would that be different?

---

**Answer:**

Yes, you can initialize a tokenizer based on an existing one, such as the GPT-2 tokenizer, and adapt it for your needs (e.g., for Portuguese). This approach can be useful if you want to leverage an existing tokenizer's configuration and vocabulary while customizing it for your specific use case, such as training it further on Portuguese data or modifying its behavior. Below, I'll explain how to initialize a tokenizer based on GPT-2, how it differs from initializing a new BPE tokenizer from scratch (as in your current code), and the implications for your Portuguese tokenizer project.

---

### Initializing a Tokenizer Based on GPT-2

The Hugging Face `tokenizers` library allows you to load an existing tokenizer (like GPT-2's) and use it as a starting point. GPT-2's tokenizer is a byte-level BPE tokenizer, which differs in some ways from the standard BPE tokenizer you're currently using with `pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()`. Here's how you can initialize a tokenizer based on GPT-2:

```python
from tokenizers import Tokenizer
from transformers import GPT2TokenizerFast

# Load the GPT-2 tokenizer
gpt2_tokenizer = GPT2TokenizerFast.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Convert it to a tokenizers library Tokenizer object
gpt2_tokenizer_backend = gpt2_tokenizer.backend_tokenizer
tokenizer = Tokenizer.from_str(gpt2_tokenizer_backend.to_str())

# Optionally, modify the tokenizer (e.g., add special tokens or retrain)
tokenizer.add_special_tokens(["[MY_NEW_TOKEN]"])  # Example modification

# Save or use the tokenizer
tokenizer.save("custom_gpt2_based_tokenizer.json")
```

---

#### Steps Explained

1. **Load GPT-2 Tokenizer:**  
   Use transformers to load the pretrained GPT-2 tokenizer.

2. **Convert to Tokenizers object:**  
   Extract the backend tokenizer from GPT2TokenizerFast and convert it to a tokenizers.Tokenizer.

3. **Modify as Needed:**  
   You can now further train, add special tokens, or otherwise modify the tokenizer for your needs.

---

**Summary of Differences:**

- GPT-2 tokenizer uses byte-level (byte-pair encoding after splitting text into bytes), making it robust for any input (rarely uses `[UNK]`).
- Whitespace BPE tokenizers split words by whitespace first, which might not handle rare tokens or typos as gracefully.
- Initializing from GPT-2 gives you its whole subword vocabulary—unless you retrain, it might not tokenize Portuguese perfectly, but it does handle OOV tokens well.

---

You can adapt GPT-2's tokenizer to Portuguese by further training/fine-tuning on Portuguese data, or by customizing its vocab/special tokens according to your needs.

Let me know if you want concrete examples for continuing training or specifics for integrating with a language model!

Here's the information from your HTML, converted and organized into Markdown.

---

- `GPT2TokenizerFast.from_pretrained("gpt2")` loads the GPT-2 tokenizer from Hugging Face's `transformers` library. This tokenizer uses byte-level BPE, trained on English text, with a vocabulary of about 50,257 tokens.

- The `backend_tokenizer` attribute accesses the underlying `tokenizers` library object, which you can manipulate.

- **Convert to Tokenizer Object:**
  - `Tokenizer.from_str(gpt2_tokenizer_backend.to_str())` creates a `tokenizers` library `Tokenizer` object from the GPT-2 tokenizer's serialized representation. This allows you to modify or retrain it.

- **Customize (Optional):**
  - You can add special tokens (e.g., `[MY_NEW_TOKEN]`), adjust the pre-tokenizer, or retrain the tokenizer on your Portuguese dataset to adapt the vocabulary.

- **Retrain (Optional):**
  - If you want to adapt the GPT-2 tokenizer for Portuguese, you can retrain it on your dataset (e.g., the `content_texts` from your conversational dataset) using `trainers.BpeTrainer`. This updates the vocabulary while retaining the GPT-2 tokenizer's structure (e.g., byte-level BPE).

```python
from tokenizers import trainers

# Define iterator for your Portuguese data
def content_iterator(dataset):
    for example in dataset:
        for content in example["content_texts"]:
            yield content

# Define trainer
trainer = trainers.BpeTrainer(
    vocab_size=50257,  # Match GPT-2's vocab size or adjust
    special_tokens=["[UNK]", "[CLS]", "[SEP]", "[PAD]", "[MASK]"],
    min_frequency=2
)

# Retrain on your dataset
tokenizer.train_from_iterator(content_iterator(dataset), trainer=trainer)

# Save the retrained tokenizer
tokenizer.save("portuguese_gpt2_based_tokenizer.json")
```

---

## Differences Between Initializing a New BPE Tokenizer vs. GPT-2-Based Tokenizer

Here’s how initializing a tokenizer based on GPT-2 differs from your current approach (`Tokenizer(models.BPE(unk_token="[UNK]"))` with `pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()`):

1. **BPE Type: Byte-Level vs. Standard BPE**
   - **Your Current Approach (Standard BPE):**
     - Uses standard BPE, which starts with a vocabulary of individual characters (or words, depending on the pre-tokenizer) and merges frequent pairs to create subword units.
     - With `pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()`, the input text is split into words based on whitespace (e.g., "Olá, como você está?" → ["Olá,", "como", "você", "está?"]), and then BPE merges subword units within those words.
     - The initial vocabulary is based on the characters/tokens in your training corpus, and the merges are learned from your Portuguese dataset.
   - **GPT-2-Based (Byte-Level BPE):**
     - Uses byte-level BPE, operating on the byte representation of text (UTF-8). The initial vocabulary includes all 256 byte values, so any input (including rare characters/emojis) can be tokenized without needing an `[UNK]` token.
     - The pre-tokenizer is `pre_tokenizers.ByteLevel()`, which splits text at the byte level and handles special characters, whitespace, and punctuation differently (for example, it uses a prefix symbol like "Ġ" for spaces).
     - The GPT-2 tokenizer comes with a pre-trained vocabulary of ~50,257 tokens optimized for English. This may not be ideal for Portuguese, as it lacks Portuguese-specific subwords (like "-ção" or "-mente").

2. **Pre-Tokenizer**
   - **Your Current Approach:** Uses `pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()`, splitting on whitespace and treating words as units. Simpler, aligns with natural Portuguese word boundaries, but may require an `[UNK]` token for unknown characters.
   - **GPT-2-Based:** Uses `pre_tokenizers.ByteLevel()`, ensuring every character (even rare ones) can be tokenized, minimizing reliance on `[UNK]`. May produce longer token sequences in Portuguese.

3. **Vocabulary**
   - **Your Current Approach:** Built from scratch using your Portuguese dataset. You control `vocab_size` (e.g., 30,000) and can tailor it for Portuguese (e.g., capturing frequent words like "você", "está").
   - **GPT-2-Based:** Starts with the English-centric pre-trained vocabulary. English words (e.g., "hello", "the") are single tokens, but Portuguese words (e.g., "olá", "você") might be split into subwords ("ol", "á", etc.). Retraining can adapt it, but some English bias may remain.

4. **Unknown Token Handling**
   - **Your Current Approach:** Explicitly includes `unk_token="[UNK]"` for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words/characters, necessary due to possible gaps in the vocabulary.
   - **GPT-2-Based:** Byte-level BPE rarely needs `[UNK]` because any input can be split into byte sequences. Still, `[UNK]` can be included for compatibility with models (e.g., BERT) that expect it.

5. **Training Effort**
   - **Your Current Approach:** Trains from scratch; needs a large, diverse Portuguese dataset. Training time depends on data size and vocab size.
   - **GPT-2-Based:** Can save time if used as-is, but will need retraining on Portuguese data to be effective, which could take similar effort to training from scratch.

6. **Use Case Suitability**
   - **Your Current Approach:** Best for creating a Portuguese-specific tokenizer tailored to your dataset; accurately captures Portuguese morphology and conversational styles.
   - **GPT-2-Based:** Useful for leveraging byte-level BPE's robustness, especially for noisy or mixed-language inputs. Without retraining, may be suboptimal for Portuguese.

---

## Implications for Your Portuguese Tokenizer Project

Since you’re building a tokenizer for Portuguese using conversational data, here’s how this affects you:

- **Starting from Scratch (Your Current Approach):**
  - **Pros:**
    - Fully customized for Portuguese, capturing language-specific and conversational subwords (e.g., "você", "está", "olá").
  - **Cons:**
    - Needs a large, diverse dataset for robust results.
    - May need to handle OOV tokens explicitly.

---

If you need further conversion or info, let me know!

Here’s your HTML converted into markdown format, focusing on the conversational and instructional content, preserving logical order and hierarchy without any HTML-specific classes or CSS:

---

- "olá").
- Smaller vocabulary size (e.g., 30,000) tailored to your dataset, potentially leading to shorter token sequences for Portuguese text.
- No English bias in the vocabulary.

#### Cons:
- Requires a large and diverse dataset to build a robust vocabulary.
- Training from scratch can be computationally intensive for very large datasets.
- May need `[UNK]` for rare characters or symbols not in the training data.

---

### Starting from GPT-2

#### Pros:
- Leverages GPT-2’s byte-level BPE, which handles any input (including rare characters, emojis, or mixed-language text) without `[UNK]`.
- Pre-trained vocabulary provides a starting point, potentially reducing training time if minimal retraining is needed.
- Robust for noisy or multilingual data, which might be relevant if your conversational dataset includes slang, code-switching, or emojis.

#### Cons:
- GPT-2’s vocabulary is English-centric, so Portuguese words may be split into suboptimal subwords (e.g., `"você"` → `["vo", "c", "ê"]`) unless retrained extensively.
- Byte-level BPE may produce longer token sequences, increasing memory and computation for downstream models.
- Retraining to adapt to Portuguese may require significant effort, potentially negating the benefit of starting with a pre-trained tokenizer.

---

### When to Use GPT-2-Based Tokenizer

**Use GPT-2 if:**
- Your dataset includes noisy or multilingual text (e.g., Portuguese mixed with English, emojis, or special characters).
- You want to leverage byte-level BPE’s ability to handle any input without `[UNK]`.
- You have limited Portuguese data and want to start with a pre-trained vocabulary, then fine-tune it.
- You’re building a tokenizer for a model similar to GPT-2 or for a multilingual application.

**Stick with Your Current Approach if:**
- You want a tokenizer optimized specifically for Portuguese, especially conversational Portuguese.
- Your dataset is large and diverse enough to train a robust vocabulary from scratch.
- You’re targeting a model that expects a standard BPE tokenizer with special tokens like `[UNK]`, `[CLS]`, `[SEP]` (e.g., BERT-style models).
- You want to minimize token sequence lengths for Portuguese text to optimize downstream model performance.

---

### Example: Comparing Tokenization

Let’s compare how the two approaches might tokenize a Portuguese sentence like `"Olá, como você está?"`:

#### Your Current Tokenizer (Standard BPE, Whitespace):
After training on Portuguese data, it might tokenize as:

```python
["Olá", ",", "como", "você", "está", "?"]
```

If `"você"` is rare and not in the vocabulary, it might become `["vo", "c", "ê"]` or `[UNK]`.

#### GPT-2-Based Tokenizer (Byte-Level BPE)
Without retraining, it might tokenize as:

```python
["Ol", "á", ",", "Ġcomo", "Ġvoc", "ê", "Ġest", "á", "?"]
```

(Note the `Ġ` prefix for spaces and splits due to English-centric vocabulary.)

After retraining on Portuguese data, it could adapt to produce more Portuguese-friendly tokens, like:

```python
["Olá", ",", "Ġcomo", "Ġvocê", "Ġestá", "?"]
```

---

### How to Decide

For your Portuguese conversational dataset, **your current approach** (initializing a new BPE tokenizer with `pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()`) is likely the better choice because:

- It’s tailored to Portuguese, ensuring the vocabulary captures language-specific patterns.
- It aligns with your goal of training a custom tokenizer for your dataset.
- It’s simpler to train from scratch for a single language than to adapt an English-centric tokenizer like GPT-2’s.

However, if you want to experiment with a GPT-2-based tokenizer, you can retrain it on your Portuguese dataset to adapt the vocabulary. This requires balancing the extent of retraining to avoid losing GPT-2’s robustness while optimizing for Portuguese.

---

### Practical Example: Retraining GPT-2 Tokenizer

Here’s how you can load, retrain, and use a GPT-2-based tokenizer for your dataset:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from tokenizers import Tokenizer, trainers
from transformers import GPT2TokenizerFast

# Load your dataset
dataset = load_dataset("json", data_files={"train": "path/to/train.json"}, split="train")

def extract_content(example):
    return {"content_texts": [conv["content"] for conv in example["conversations"] if "content" in conv]}

dataset = dataset.map(extract_content)
dataset = dataset.shuffle(seed=42).select(range(1000))  # Your sampling

# Load GPT-2 tokenizer
gpt2_tokenizer = GPT2TokenizerFast.from_pretrained("gpt2")
tokenizer = Tokenizer.from_str(gpt2_tokenizer.backend_tokenizer.to_str())

# Define iterator
def content_iterator(dataset):
    for example in dataset:
        for content in example["content_texts"]:
            yield content

# Retrain on Portuguese data
trainer = trainers.BpeTrainer(
    vocab_size=50257,  # Match GPT-2's vocab size
    special_tokens=["[UNK]", "[CLS]", "[SEP]", "[PAD]", "[MASK]"],
    min_frequency=2
)
tokenizer.train_from_iterator(content_iterator(dataset), trainer=trainer)

# Save the retrained tokenizer
tokenizer.save("portuguese_gpt2_based_tokenizer.json")

# Test tokenization
encoded = tokenizer.encode("Olá, como você está?")
```

## Testing and Validation

After training either tokenizer, test it on Portuguese text to compare:

- **Token Sequence Length:** Shorter sequences are better for model efficiency.
- **OOV Handling:** Check how often `[UNK]` appears (for your current approach) or if byte-level BPE handles rare inputs well (for GPT-2-based).
- **Portuguese-Specific Patterns:** Ensure common Portuguese words (e.g., `"você"`, `"está"`) are tokenized as single units rather than split.

See attached the code I'm running. Something is wrong, when I check the vocabulary after training all tokens are for single characters. It is not merging token pairs to create new tokens.

---

Thank you for sharing the code snippet and the issue you're encountering. It seems that your BPE tokenizer is not merging token pairs as expected, and the resulting vocabulary contains only single characters. This is a common issue when training a BPE tokenizer, and it typically indicates that the training process isn't effectively learning frequent pairs to merge into subword units. Let's analyze the problem, identify potential causes, and provide a solution.

## Problem Description

- **Expected Behavior:**  
  With BPE (Byte-Pair Encoding), the tokenizer should start with a vocabulary of individual characters (or bytes, depending on the pre-tokenizer) and iteratively merge the most frequent pairs of tokens into new subword units. For example, after training on Portuguese text, you might expect pairs like `"qu"`, `"ção"`, or `"você"` to emerge as tokens.
- **Observed Behavior:**  
  Your vocabulary contains only single characters (e.g., `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"`, etc.), suggesting that no merges are occurring during training.

## Potential Causes

Based on the provided code, here are the likely reasons why the tokenizer isn't merging token pairs:

1. **Insufficient Data or Low Frequency of Pairs:**
    - BPE relies on the frequency of token pairs in the training data to decide which pairs to merge. If your dataset (after sampling with `select(range(1000))`) is too small or lacks repeated patterns, the `min_frequency` threshold might prevent any merges.
    - In your code, `min_frequency=2` means a pair must appear at least twice to be considered for merging. With only 1,000 samples, the diversity or repetition might be too low to meet this threshold.

2. **Pre-Tokenizer Issue:**
    - You're using `pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()`, which splits text into words based on whitespace (e.g., `"Olá, como você está?"` → `["Olá,", "como", "você", "está?"]`). BPE then operates on these pre-tokenized units. If the pre-tokenized units are too large or lack frequent internal pairs (e.g., due to punctuation or low word overlap), merges might not occur within words.
    - Additionally, `Whitespace()` doesn't handle character-level merging directly; it relies on BPE to find subword patterns within the pre-tokenized units.

3. **Training Data Iterator:**
    - The `content_iterator` function yields individual `"content"` strings from the `"content_texts"` list. If the iterator doesn't provide enough overlapping text or if the data is too fragmented (e.g., each `"content"` is a unique sentence with no repetition), BPE won't find frequent pairs to merge.

4. **Trainer Configuration:**
    - The `vocab_size=30000` is reasonable, but if the training process stops early due to insufficient data or pair frequency, the vocabulary won't grow beyond single characters.
    - The `show_progress=True` is fine but doesn't affect the merging logic.

5. **Dataset Sampling:**
    - Sampling only 1,000 examples with `dataset.shuffle(seed=42).select(range(1000))` might limit the diversity and frequency of token pairs, especially if the original dataset is large but the sample doesn't capture enough repetition.

---

## Debugging and Solution

To fix the issue and ensure BPE merges token pairs into subword units, let's troubleshoot and adjust the code step-by-step.

### 1. Verify the Dataset and Iterator

- **Check Dataset Size and Content:**  
  Ensure your sampled dataset (1,000 examples) contains enough text with repeated patterns. For example, conversational data should have common phrases or words (e.g., `"você"`, `"está"`, `"como"`) that can be merged.

- **Modify the Iterator:**  
  The current `content_iterator` yields each `"content"` string individually. This is correct, but ensure the dataset's `"content_texts"` contains meaningful text. If each `"content"` is a unique, short phrase with no overlap, merges won't occur. Consider concatenating the `"content_texts"` into larger blocks to increase pair frequency.

```python
# Example: Concatenating multiple content texts into larger blocks
content_texts = [...]
block_size = 10
for i in range(0, len(content_texts), block_size):
    block = " ".join(content_texts[i:i + block_size])
    yield block
```

---

If you implement these changes and still don't see merging, try lowering `min_frequency`, increasing your sample size, or experimenting with `pre_tokenizers.ByteLevel()` or `pre_tokenizers.ByteLevel(trim_offsets=False)` if your dataset contains rich Unicode characters.

Let me know if you want code review or further step-by-step debugging!

Here is your content in **Markdown** format:

---

#### 1. Concatenate content_texts

```python
def content_iterator(dataset):
    # Concatenate all content_texts into a single string per row
    for row in dataset:
        content_block = " ".join(row["content_texts"])
        yield content_block
```
This approach increases the chance of finding frequent pairs within and across sentences.

---

### 2. Adjust `min_frequency`

- Lower `min_frequency` to 1 to allow merges even for pairs that appear only once, which can help with small datasets:

```python
trainer = trainers.BpeTrainer(
    vocab_size=30000,
    special_tokens=["[UNK]"],
    min_frequency=1,  # Reduced from 2
    show_progress=True
)
```

- **Be cautious**: A `min_frequency` of 1 might include noisy or rare pairs, so monitor the vocabulary quality after training.

---

### 3. Increase Dataset Size or Diversity

- If possible, increase `args.num_samples` (e.g., to 5,000 or 10,000) to provide more data for BPE to find frequent pairs. Check the original dataset size with `len(dataset)` before sampling to ensure 1,000 is a reasonable fraction.
- Alternatively, combine your dataset with a larger Portuguese corpus (e.g., Wikipedia or OSCAR) to boost diversity and repetition.

---

### 4. Test with a Smaller `vocab_size` Initially

- Start with a smaller `vocab_size` (e.g., 1,000 or 5,000) to ensure the training process completes and merges occur. You can increase it later once the merging works.

```python
trainer = trainers.BpeTrainer(
    vocab_size=5000,  # Reduced for testing
    special_tokens=["[UNK]"],
    min_frequency=1,
    show_progress=True
)
```

---

### 5. Inspect the Vocabulary After Training

- After training, check the vocabulary to confirm merges:

```python
tokenizer.train_from_iterator(content_iterator(dataset), trainer=trainer)
vocab = tokenizer.get_vocab()
print(list(vocab.keys())[:50])  # Print first 50 tokens to inspect
```

- Look for multi-character tokens (e.g., `"qu"`, `"ção"`, `"est"`) instead of just single characters (`"a"`, `"b"`, etc.).

---

### Updated Code

Here’s an updated version of your code incorporating the suggested changes:

```python
from tokenizers import Tokenizer, models, pre_tokenizers, trainers
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load and preprocess dataset
dataset = load_dataset(
    "json", 
    data_files={"train": "path/to/train.json"}, 
    split="train"
)

def extract_content(example):
    return {
        "content_texts": [
            conv["content"] 
            for conv in example["conversations"] 
            if "content" in conv
        ]
    }

dataset = dataset.map(extract_content)
dataset = dataset.shuffle(seed=42).select(range(5000))  # Increased to 5,000 samples

# Create iterator for content_texts
def content_iterator(dataset):
    for row in dataset:
        content_block = " ".join(row["content_texts"])  # Concatenate for more context
        yield content_block

# Initialize tokenizer
tokenizer = Tokenizer(models.BPE(unk_token="[UNK]"))
tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()

# Define trainer
trainer = trainers.BpeTrainer(
    vocab_size=5000,  # Start with smaller vocab for testing
    special_tokens=["[UNK]"],
    min_frequency=1,  # Allow merges for pairs appearing once
    show_progress=True
)

# Train tokenizer
tokenizer.train_from_iterator(content_iterator(dataset), trainer=trainer)

# Inspect vocabulary
vocab = tokenizer.get_vocab()
print("Sample vocabulary:", list(vocab.keys())[:50])
```

---

### Additional Debugging Tips

- **Check Pre-Tokenized Output**: Before training, test the pre-tokenizer on a sample text to ensure it splits correctly:

    ```python
    sample_text = "Olá, como você está?"
    pre_tokenized = tokenizer.pre_tokenizer.pre_tokenize_str(sample_text)
    print(pre_tokenized)  # Should show ["Olá,", "como", "você", "está?"]
    ```

- **Monitor Progress**: The `show_progress=True` output should indicate the number of merges. If it shows 0 merges, the issue is likely data-related.

- **Test with Synthetic Data**: Create a small synthetic dataset with repeated phrases (e.g., `"ola ola ola"` repeated 100 times) to verify that merging works:

    ```python
    from datasets import Dataset
    synthetic_data = {"content_texts": [["ola ola ola"] * 100]}
    synthetic_dataset = Dataset.from_dict(synthetic_data)
    tokenizer.train_from_iterator(content_iterator(synthetic_dataset), trainer=trainer)
    ```

### Why Merging Didn’t Happen

The most likely cause is that your sampled dataset (1,000 examples) didn’t provide enough repeated token pairs to exceed `min_frequency=2`. Concatenating `"content_texts"` and lowering `min_frequency` should help. If the issue persists, the dataset might lack sufficient overlap (e.g., all `"content"` strings are unique), or the pre-tokenizer might be splitting text in a way that prevents meaningful merges.

---

### Next Steps

- Run the updated code and check the vocabulary.
- If merges still don’t occur, share the output of `print(list(vocab.keys())[:50])` or details about your dataset (e.g., sample `"content_texts"`) for further diagnosis.
- Once merging works, gradually increase `vocab_size` and `num_samples` to build a robust vocabulary.

ok, my iterator was the root cause. it is fixed now and trainning is working nice and using the 30000-vocabulary size available. However, it is still using tokens for emoji and chineses characters that are not present in my training date. How can I prevent it from happening?

---

I'm glad to hear that the iterator issue is resolved and the training is now working with your 30,000-vocabulary size! The new issue you're encountering—where the tokenizer is using tokens for emojis and Chinese characters that aren't present in your training data—suggests that the tokenizer is falling back to some default or pre-existing behavior, likely due to the way BPE handles out-of-vocabulary (OOV) characters or the pre-tokenizer configuration. Since your training data is Portuguese conversational text, these tokens shouldn't appear unless the tokenizer is designed to handle them from an external source (e.g., a pre-trained vocabulary) or due to its byte-level capabilities. Let's address this step-by-step.

---

### Why This Is Happening

1. **Byte-Level Capability of BPE**
   - Even though you initialized the tokenizer with `models.BPE(unk_token="[UNK]")` and `pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()`, the underlying BPE implementation in the `tokenizers` library can operate on byte-level representations if it encounters characters not covered by the pre-tokenizer or vocabulary. This is a feature of BPE to ensure it can tokenize any input, including Unicode characters like emojis (😊) or Chinese characters (你).
   - During training, if your dataset contains no emojis or Chinese characters, these characters won't be merged into subword units, and the tokenizer may default to representing them as individual byte sequences or fallback tokens.
2. **Pre-Tokenizer Behavior**
   - The `pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()` splits text on whitespace, but it doesn't filter out or handle special Unicode characters. If an emoji or Chinese character appears in the input text (e.g., due to test data or noise), the pre-tokenizer passes it through, and BPE tries to tokenize it based on its byte representation.
3. **Lack of `[UNK]` Enforcement**
   - You’ve set `unk_token="[UNK]"` and included it in `special_tokens`, but if the tokenizer encounters characters it can represent at the byte level (e.g., UTF-8 bytes for emojis or Chinese characters), it might not use `[UNK]` unless explicitly enforced for OOV cases.
4. **Test Data Contamination**
   - If you're testing the tokenizer with text containing emojis or Chinese characters (e.g., `"Olá 😊 你好"`), and these weren't in the training data, the tokenizer is likely breaking them into byte-level tokens rather than mapping them to `[UNK]`.

---

### How to Prevent This

To ensure the tokenizer only uses tokens learned from your Portuguese training data and maps unseen characters (like emojis and Chinese characters) to `[UNK]`, you can take the following steps:

#### 1. Enforce `[UNK]` for OOV Characters

- Modify the tokenizer to strictly use `[UNK]` for any character or sequence not in the trained vocabulary. By default, BPE with a byte-level fallback might tokenize unseen Unicode characters, but you can override this behavior.
- After training, set the tokenizer to replace OOV tokens with `[UNK]`:

```python
# After training
tokenizer.post_processor = None  # Remove any default post-processing
tokenizer.enable_truncation(max_length=512)  # Optional, for length control
tokenizer.enable_padding(pad_id=tokenizer.token_to_id("[PAD]"))  # Optional, for padding

# Ensure OOV handling with [UNK]
tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"unk_token": "[UNK]"})
tokenizer.unk_token_id = tokenizer.token_to_id("[UNK]")

# Test with OOV characters
test_text = "Olá 😊 你好"
encoded = tokenizer.encode(test_text)
print(encoded.tokens)  # Should show ["Olá", "[UNK]", "[UNK]"]
```

- **Explanation:** Adding the `unk_token` and setting `unk_token_id` ensures that any token not in the vocabulary (including emojis and Chinese characters) is replaced with `[UNK]`. This overrides the byte-level fallback behavior for OOV cases.

#### 2. Use a Character-Level Filter in Pre-Tokenization

- Modify the pre-tokenizer to filter out or handle non-Portuguese characters before BPE processing. Since `pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()` doesn't filter characters, you can create a custom pre-tokenizer to normalize or reject emojis and non-Latin characters.
- Example using a custom pre-tokenizer:

```python
from tokenizers import pre_tokenizers
from tokenizers.pre_tokenizers import PreTokenizerCustom

def keep_latin_chars(text):
    # Keep only Latin characters, numbers, and basic punctuation
    return ''.join(c for c in text if c.isascii() and (c.isalnum()))
    # You may want to add further logic depending on what you allow.
```

*(You will need to integrate this function as a custom tokenizer or part of your data preprocessing pipeline.)*

If you need more practical code for integrating the filter or for enforcing `[UNK]` further, let me know!

Here's your content converted from HTML to Markdown. All formatting, colors, spacing, and font details have been removed, leaving just the Markdown version.  

---

```python
(c.isalnum() or c in " ,.!?")
custom_pre_tokenizer = PreTokenizerCustom(keep_latin_chars)
tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = custom_pre_tokenizer
```

- **Explanation:** This custom pre-tokenizer strips out non-ASCII characters (e.g., emojis, Chinese characters) before tokenization, ensuring only Portuguese-relevant text is processed. However, this might be too restrictive if your data includes valid Unicode characters (e.g., accented letters like "á" or "ç"). A more refined approach might use a regular expression to allow Portuguese-specific characters:

```python
import re

def keep_portuguese_chars(text):
    # Keep Latin characters, Portuguese accents, numbers, and basic punctuation
    return re.sub(r'[^\w\sáéíóúâêîôûãõçÀ-ÿ,.!?]', '', text)

custom_pre_tokenizer = PreTokenizerCustom(keep_portuguese_chars)
tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = custom_pre_tokenizer
```

- **Explanation:** After applying this, retrain the tokenizer on your dataset to rebuild the vocabulary without non-Portuguese characters influencing the merges.

### 3. Retrain with Cleaned Data

- If your training data inadvertently contains emojis or Chinese characters (e.g., due to noise or scraping), clean the data before training. Update your `extract_content` function to filter out non-Portuguese characters:

```python
def extract_content(example):
    content_texts = [
        re.sub(r'[^\w\sáéíóúâêîôûãõçÀ-ÿ,.!?]', '', conv["content"])
        for conv in example["conversations"] if "content" in conv
    ]
    return {"content_texts": content_texts}

dataset = dataset.map(extract_content)
```

- **Explanation:** This preprocessing step removes emojis and non-Portuguese characters from the training data, ensuring the tokenizer learns only from Portuguese text. Then, retrain the tokenizer:

```python
tokenizer.train_from_iterator(content_iterator(dataset), trainer=trainer)
```

### 4. Validate Training Data

- Inspect your dataset to confirm it doesn’t contain emojis or Chinese characters. Print a sample:

```python
for i in range(10):
    print(dataset[i]["content_texts"])
```

- If unwanted characters are present, clean them as described above before retraining.

### 5. Use Byte-Level BPE with Explicit OOV Handling (Alternative)

- If you prefer the robustness of byte-level BPE (like GPT-2) but want to enforce `[UNK]` for non-Portuguese characters, initialize the tokenizer with `models.BPE` and a byte-level pre-tokenizer, then enforce OOV handling:

```python
from tokenizers import pre_tokenizers

tokenizer = Tokenizer(models.BPE(unk_token="[UNK]"))
tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.ByteLevel()
tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"unk_token": "[UNK]"})
tokenizer.unk_token_id = tokenizer.token_to_id("[UNK]")

# Train and enforce [UNK] as above
```

- However, since you’re focused on Portuguese, the custom pre-tokenizer approach (Option 2) is likely better to avoid byte-level complexity.

---

## Recommended Solution

The most straightforward and effective solution for your case is a combination of **Option 1 (Enforce [UNK]) and Option 3 (Retrain with Cleaned Data)**:

1. Clean your training data to remove emojis and non-Portuguese characters.
2. Retrain the tokenizer.
3. Configure the tokenizer to use `[UNK]` for OOV tokens.

Here’s the updated workflow:

```python
from tokenizers import Tokenizer, models, pre_tokenizers, trainers
from datasets import load_dataset
import re

# Load and preprocess dataset
dataset = load_dataset("json", data_files={"train": "path/to/train.json"}, split="train")

def extract_content(example):
    content_texts = [
        re.sub(r'[^\w\sáéíóúâêîôûãõçÀ-ÿ,.!?]', '', conv["content"])
        for conv in example["conversations"] if "content" in conv
    ]
    return {"content_texts": content_texts}

dataset = dataset.map(extract_content)
dataset = dataset.shuffle(seed=42).select(range(5000))  # Adjusted sample size

# Create iterator for content_texts
def content_iterator(dataset):
    for row in dataset:
        content_block = " ".join(row["content_texts"])
        yield content_block

# Initialize tokenizer
tokenizer = Tokenizer(models.BPE(unk_token="[UNK]"))
tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()

# Define trainer
trainer = trainers.BpeTrainer(
    vocab_size=30000,
    special_tokens=["[UNK]"],
    min_frequency=1,
    show_progress=True
)

# Train tokenizer
tokenizer.train_from_iterator(content_iterator(dataset), trainer=trainer)

# Enforce [UNK] for OOV tokens
tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"unk_token": "[UNK]"})
tokenizer.unk_token_id = tokenizer.token_to_id("[UNK]")

# Save tokenizer
tokenizer.save("portuguese_bpe_tokenizer.json")

# Test with OOV characters
test_text = "Olá 😊 你好"
encoded = tokenizer.encode(test_text)
print("Tokens:", encoded.tokens)  # Should show ["Olá", "[UNK]", "[UNK]"]
```

## Validation

*(No further content in this section from input.)*

---

Let me know if you need further simplification!

Here is your content converted to Markdown:

---

## Validation

- After retraining, test the tokenizer with text containing emojis and Chinese characters to confirm `[UNK]` is used:

```python
test_texts = ["Olá 😊", "你好 mundo", "Olá, tudo bem? 😄"]

for text in test_texts:
    encoded = tokenizer.encode(text)
    print(f"Text: {text}, Tokens: {encoded.tokens}")
```

- Expected output should replace emojis and Chinese characters with `[UNK]`, e.g., `["Olá", "[UNK]"]`.

---

## Additional Considerations

- **Performance Impact**:  
  Using `[UNK]` for OOV characters won’t significantly affect performance but ensures your tokenizer stays focused on Portuguese.

- **Edge Cases**:  
  If your conversational data might legitimately include emojis (e.g., `"Olá 😊"`), decide whether to allow them as `[UNK]` or add a custom token (e.g., `[EMOJI]`) with additional preprocessing.

- **Vocabulary Inspection**:  
  Check the trained vocabulary to ensure it contains Portuguese subwords (e.g., `"ção"`, `"est"`) and no unexpected Unicode tokens:

```python
vocab = tokenizer.get_vocab()
print("Sample vocabulary:", list(vocab.keys())[:50])
```

## Question

> I have double checked my training data and there are no special characters on it. So, how do I exclude it from initial token list?

---

## Answer

Since you've double-checked your training data and confirmed that there are no special characters (e.g., emojis or Chinese characters), the issue of the tokenizer using tokens for these characters must stem from the tokenizer's default behavior or its ability to handle any Unicode input at the byte level, even without seeing them during training.  
This is a characteristic of BPE when combined with the `tokenizers` library's flexibility, especially if it falls back to byte-level representation for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) characters.

To exclude these unwanted tokens from the initial token list and ensure the tokenizer only uses tokens learned from your Portuguese data, we need to adjust the tokenizer's configuration and behavior. Here's how to address this:

---

### Why This Happens

- Even though your training data contains only Portuguese text (e.g., Latin characters with accents like `"á"`, `"ç"`, etc.), the BPE algorithm in the `tokenizers` library starts with a base vocabulary that can include all possible byte values (0-255) if not constrained. The `pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()` pre-tokenizer splits on whitespace, but it doesn't prevent the tokenizer from processing any Unicode input (e.g., emojis or Chinese characters) as byte sequences during inference.
- When you test the tokenizer with text containing special characters (e.g., `"Olá 😊"`), it tokenizes them into byte-level representations because they weren't merged into subword units during training (due to their absence in the data). This results in unexpected tokens rather than mapping them to `[UNK]`.

---

### How to Exclude Unwanted Characters

To ensure the tokenizer only uses tokens from your Portuguese training data and excludes tokens for special characters (like emojis and Chinese characters) from the initial token list, you can take the following steps:

#### 1. Enforce Strict Vocabulary Control

- After training, limit the tokenizer's vocabulary to only the tokens learned from your data. By default, the tokenizer might allow byte-level fallback for OOV characters, but you can enforce that only the trained vocabulary is used, with `[UNK]` for anything else.
- Update the tokenizer post-training to restrict its token set:

```python
# After training
trained_vocab = tokenizer.get_vocab()
tokenizer = Tokenizer(models.BPE(unk_token="[UNK]"))  # Reinitialize to reset
tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()

# Set the trained vocabulary explicitly
tokenizer.model = models.BPE(
    vocab=trained_vocab,
    merges=sorted(tokenizer.model.merges.items()) if hasattr(tokenizer.model, 'merges') else [],
    unk_token="[UNK]"
)

# Ensure [UNK] is used for OOV
tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"unk_token": "[UNK]"})
tokenizer.unk_token_id = tokenizer.token_to_id("[UNK]")

# Save the updated tokenizer
tokenizer.save("portuguese_bpe_tokenizer_cleaned.json")
```

- **Explanation**:  
  This re-initializes the tokenizer with only the vocabulary (`trained_vocab`) and merges learned during training on your Portuguese data. Any input not in this vocabulary (e.g., emojis, Chinese characters) will be mapped to `[UNK]`, preventing the creation of new byte-level tokens.

, preventing the creation of new byte-level tokens.

## 2. Customize the Pre-Tokenizer to Reject Non-Portuguese Characters

- Modify the pre-tokenizer to filter out non-Portuguese characters before tokenization. This ensures that during inference, special characters are either removed or replaced before the BPE process, preventing them from being tokenized into byte sequences.
- Use a custom pre-tokenizer to keep only Portuguese-relevant characters:

```python
from tokenizers import pre_tokenizers
from tokenizers.pre_tokenizers import PreTokenizerCustom
import re

def keep_portuguese_chars(text):
    # Keep Latin characters, Portuguese accents, numbers, and basic punctuation
    return re.sub(r'[^\w\sáéíóúâêîôûãõçÀ-ÿ,.!?]', '', text)

custom_pre_tokenizer = PreTokenizerCustom(keep_portuguese_chars)
tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = custom_pre_tokenizer
```

- **Explanation**: This pre-tokenizer removes emojis, Chinese characters, and other non-Portuguese Unicode characters before the BPE algorithm processes the text. Since your training data lacks these characters, this step ensures consistency during inference. Note that you’ll need to re-train the tokenizer after applying this pre-tokenizer to rebuild the vocabulary.

---

## 3. Retrain with the Custom Pre-Tokenizer

- Since your training data is clean, retrain the tokenizer with the custom pre-tokenizer to ensure the vocabulary is built only from Portuguese text, and the tokenizer won't attempt to handle special characters:

```python
from tokenizers import Tokenizer, models, pre_tokenizers, trainers
from datasets import load_dataset
import re

# Load and preprocess dataset
dataset = load_dataset("json", data_files={"train": "path/to/train.json"}, split="train")

def extract_content(example):
    content_texts = [conv["content"] for conv in example["conversations"] if "content" in conv]
    return {"content_texts": content_texts}

dataset = dataset.map(extract_content)
dataset = dataset.shuffle(seed=42).select(range(5000))

# Create iterator
def content_iterator(dataset):
    for row in dataset:
        content_block = " ".join(row["content_texts"])
        yield content_block

# Initialize tokenizer with custom pre-tokenizer
tokenizer = Tokenizer(models.BPE(unk_token="[UNK]"))

def keep_portuguese_chars(text):
    return re.sub(r'[^\w\sáéíóúâêîôûãõçÀ-ÿ,.!?]', '', text)

tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.PreTokenizerCustom(keep_portuguese_chars)

# Define trainer
trainer = trainers.BpeTrainer(
    vocab_size=30000,
    special_tokens=["[UNK]"],
    min_frequency=1,
    show_progress=True
)

# Train tokenizer
tokenizer.train_from_iterator(content_iterator(dataset), trainer=trainer)

# Enforce [UNK] for OOV
tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"unk_token": "[UNK]"})
tokenizer.unk_token_id = tokenizer.token_to_id("[UNK]")

# Save tokenizer
tokenizer.save("portuguese_bpe_tokenizer_cleaned.json")

# Test
test_text = "Olá 😊 你好"
encoded = tokenizer.encode(test_text)
print("Tokens:", encoded.tokens)  # Should show ["Olá", "", ""] or ["Olá", "[UNK]", "[UNK]"]
```

- **Explanation**: The custom pre-tokenizer filters out non-Portuguese characters during training and inference, ensuring the vocabulary is built only from your data. The `[UNK]` enforcement handles any remaining OOV cases. Note that the output might include empty strings (`""`) where special characters were removed; you can adjust the pre-tokenizer to replace them with `[UNK]` if desired.

---

## 4. Adjust Post-Processing to Handle OOV

- Add a post-processor to replace any pre-tokenized units containing non-Portuguese characters with `[UNK]`:

```python
from tokenizers.processors import TemplateProcessing

tokenizer.post_processor = TemplateProcessing(
    single="[CLS] $A [SEP]",
    special_tokens=[
        ("[CLS]", tokenizer.token_to_id("[CLS]")), 
        ("[SEP]", tokenizer.token_to_id("[SEP]"))
    ]
)

# Custom logic to replace OOV pre-tokenized units
def replace_oov_pre_tokens(encoded):
    new_tokens = []
    for token in encoded.tokens:
        if not re.match(r'^[\w\sáéíóúâêîôûãõçÀ-ÿ,.!?]+$', token):
            new_tokens.append("[UNK]")
        else:
            new_tokens.append(token)
    encoded.tokens = new_tokens
    return encoded

# Apply during encoding
test_text = "Olá 😊 你好"
encoded = tokenizer.encode(test_text)
encoded = replace_oov_pre_tokens(encoded)
print("Tokens:", encoded.tokens)  # Should show ["Olá", "[UNK]", "[UNK]"]
```

- **Explanation**: This post-processing step checks each token after pre-tokenization and replaces non-Portuguese sequences with `[UNK]`. You’d need to integrate this into the encoding pipeline, which might require a custom wrapper.

---

## Recommended Approach

The simplest and most effective solution is **Option 3 (Retrain with Custom Pre-Tokenizer)**, as it:

- Ensures the tokenizer is trained only on Portuguese text.
- Prevents byte-level tokenization of special characters by filtering them out early.
- Maintains your 30,000-vocabulary size with learned subword units.

Here’s the finalized code:

```python
from tokenizers import Tokenizer, models, pre_tokenizers, trainers
from datasets import load_dataset
import re

# Load and preprocess dataset
dataset = load_dataset("json", data_files={"train": "path/to/train.json"}, split="train")

def extract_content(example):
    content_texts = [conv["content"] for conv in example["conversations"] if "content" in conv]
    return {"content_texts": content_texts}

dataset = dataset.map(extract_content)
dataset = dataset.shuffle(seed=42).select(range(5000))

# Create iterator
def content_iterator(dataset):
    for row in dataset:
        content_block = " ".join(row["content_texts"])
        yield content_block

# Initialize tokenizer with custom pre-tokenizer
tokenizer = Tokenizer(models.BPE(unk_token="[UNK]"))

def keep_portuguese_chars(text):
    return re.sub(r'[^\w\sáéíóúâêîôûãõçÀ-ÿ,.!?]', '', text)

tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.PreTokenizerCustom(keep_portuguese_chars)

# Define trainer
trainer = trainers.BpeTrainer(
    vocab_size=30000,
    special_tokens=["[UNK]"],
    min_frequency=1,
    show_progress=True
)

# Train tokenizer
tokenizer.train_from_iterator(content_iterator(dataset), trainer=trainer)

# Enforce [UNK] for OOV
tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"unk_token": "[UNK]"})
tokenizer.unk_token_id = tokenizer.token_to_id("[UNK]")

# Save tokenizer
tokenizer.save("portuguese_bpe_tokenizer_cleaned.json")
```

If you need any further markdown formatting or wish to remove some code blocks, let me know!

Here’s the full conversation in Markdown format, with only the meaningful content and without HTML/CSS styling:

---

```python
row["content_texts"])
    yield content_block

# Initialize tokenizer with custom pre-tokenizer
tokenizer = Tokenizer(models.BPE(unk_token="[UNK]"))

def keep_portuguese_chars(text):
    return re.sub(r'[^\w\sáéíóúâêîôûãõçÀ-ÿ,.!?]', '', text)
tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.PreTokenizerCustom(keep_portuguese_chars)

# Define trainer
trainer = trainers.BpeTrainer(
    vocab_size=30000,
    special_tokens=["[UNK]"],
    min_frequency=1,
    show_progress=True
)

# Train tokenizer
tokenizer.train_from_iterator(content_iterator(dataset), trainer=trainer)

# Enforce [UNK] for OOV
tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"unk_token": "[UNK]"})
tokenizer.unk_token_id = tokenizer.token_to_id("[UNK]")

# Save tokenizer
tokenizer.save("portuguese_bpe_tokenizer_cleaned.json")

# Test
test_texts = ["Olá 😊", "你好 mundo", "Olá, tudo bem? 😄"]
for text in test_texts:
    encoded = tokenizer.encode(text)
    print(f"Text: {text}, Tokens: {encoded.tokens}")
```

---

### Expected Output

- Text: Olá 😊, Tokens: ["Olá", ""] or ["Olá", "[UNK]"] (depending on pre-tokenizer behavior).
- Text: 你好 mundo, Tokens: ["", "mundo"] or ["[UNK]", "mundo"].
- Text: Olá, tudo bem? 😄, Tokens: ["Olá", "tudo", "bem", "?"] or with [UNK] for the emoji.

If empty strings appear, you can modify `keep_portuguese_chars` to replace filtered characters with `[UNK]`:

```python
def keep_portuguese_chars(text):
    cleaned = re.sub(r'[^\w\sáéíóúâêîôûãõçÀ-ÿ,.!?]', '[UNK]', text)
    return cleaned
```

---

### Validation

- Test with various inputs containing emojis and Chinese characters to confirm they’re excluded or mapped to `[UNK]`.
- Check the vocabulary:

```python
vocab = tokenizer.get_vocab()
print("Sample vocabulary:", list(vocab.keys())[:50])
```

Ensure no unexpected Unicode tokens (e.g., byte sequences for emojis) are present.

---

### Additional Notes

**Performance**: Filtering non-Portuguese characters has minimal impact but ensures the tokenizer stays focused on your data.

**Flexibility**: If you later need to handle emojis legitimately, you can add a custom token (e.g., `[EMOJI]`) and update the pre-tokenizer accordingly.

**Debugging**: If the issue persists, share the `encoded.tokens` output for a test case, and I’ll refine the solution.

Let me know how this works or if you need further adjustments!

## Error Discussion

```
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[87], line 2
      1 # Ensure [UNK] is used for OOV
----> 2 tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"unk_token": "[UNK]"})
      3 tokenizer.unk_token_id = tokenizer.token_to_id("[UNK]")

TypeError: argument 'tokens': 'dict' object cannot be converted to 'PyList'
```

The error you're encountering,

`TypeError: argument 'tokens': 'dict' object cannot be converted to 'PyList'`

occurs when calling

`tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"unk_token": "[UNK]"})`.

This indicates that the `add_special_tokens` method expects a list of token strings (or a specific format) rather than a dictionary.

### Cause of the Error

- The `add_special_tokens` method in the `tokenizers` library expects a list of strings (e.g., `["[UNK]", "[CLS]", "[SEP]"]`) or a dictionary with specific keys (e.g., `{"additional_special_tokens": ["[UNK]"]}`) to add multiple tokens at once.  
- Passing `{"unk_token": "[UNK]"}` directly is interpreted as an invalid argument because the method doesn't know how to handle this dictionary unless formatted correctly.
- The correct way to set the unknown token or add special tokens depends on the tokenizer's state and use. Since you've already set `unk_token="[UNK]"` during initialization (with `models.BPE(unk_token="[UNK]")`) and included it in the `special_tokens` list during training, the issue might stem from trying to re-add it incorrectly.

### Solution

To fix this, use the appropriate method to add or enforce the `[UNK]` token.  
Here are the steps to resolve the issue and ensure `[UNK]` is properly handled for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) cases:

#### 1. Correct Syntax for Adding Special Tokens

If you need to add special tokens, do so with a **list**:
```python
tokenizer.add_special_tokens(["[UNK]"])
```
or for additional tokens:
```python
tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"additional_special_tokens": ["[UNK]"]})
```

But since you've already set `[UNK]` at model initialization and trainer, you might not need to add it again.

#### 2. Setting Unknown Token

To set the unknown token ID:
```python
tokenizer.unk_token_id = tokenizer.token_to_id("[UNK]")
```

---

**Summary:**  
Change  
```python
tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"unk_token": "[UNK]"})
```
to  
```python
tokenizer.add_special_tokens(["[UNK]"])
```
or remove it if `[UNK]` was already set in the trainer.

---

Let me know if you want any further clarifications or edits!

Here is your content, converted from HTML to Markdown:

---

## 1. Correct Syntax for Adding Special Tokens

- If you want to add or reinforce `[UNK]` as a special token after training, use a list of tokens or the correct dictionary format:

```python
tokenizer.add_special_tokens(["[UNK]"])  # Add [UNK] as a special token
tokenizer.unk_token_id = tokenizer.token_to_id("[UNK]")  # Set the unk_token_id
```

- Alternatively, if you want to update the tokenizer's special tokens configuration, use a dictionary with the `additional_special_tokens` key:

```python
tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"additional_special_tokens": ["[UNK]"]})
tokenizer.unk_token_id = tokenizer.token_to_id("[UNK]")
```

---

## 2. Verify Initial Configuration

- Since you initialized the tokenizer with `models.BPE(unk_token="[UNK]")` and included `["[UNK]"]` in the `special_tokens` list during training with `BpeTrainer`, the `[UNK]` token should already be part of the vocabulary. The error suggests that `add_special_tokens` is being called incorrectly after training, possibly because the tokenizer's state has changed or the method is being misused.

- Check if `[UNK]` is already in the vocabulary:

```python
print("Vocab contains [UNK]:", "[UNK]" in tokenizer.get_vocab())
```

- If it’s already present, you don’t need to add it again; you only need to set the `unk_token_id`:

```python
tokenizer.unk_token_id = tokenizer.token_to_id("[UNK]")
```

---

## 3. Update the Code

Here’s the corrected version of your code snippet, integrated into the full workflow, to ensure `[UNK]` is handled properly without causing the `TypeError`:

```python
from tokenizers import Tokenizer, models, pre_tokenizers, trainers
from datasets import load_dataset
import re

# Load and preprocess dataset
dataset = load_dataset("json", data_files={"train": "path/to/train.json"}, split="train")

def extract_content(example):
    content_texts = [conv["content"] for conv in example["conversations"] if "content" in conv]
    return {"content_texts": content_texts}

dataset = dataset.map(extract_content)
dataset = dataset.shuffle(seed=42).select(range(5000))

# Create iterator
def content_iterator(dataset):
    for row in dataset:
        content_block = " ".join(row["content_texts"])
        yield content_block

# Initialize tokenizer with custom pre-tokenizer
tokenizer = Tokenizer(models.BPE(unk_token="[UNK]"))

def keep_portuguese_chars(text):
    return re.sub(r'[^\w\sáéíóúâêîôûãõçÀ-ÿ,.!?]', '', text)

tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.PreTokenizerCustom(keep_portuguese_chars)

# Define trainer
trainer = trainers.BpeTrainer(
    vocab_size=30000,
    special_tokens=["[UNK]"],  # [UNK] is already a special token
    min_frequency=1,
    show_progress=True
)

# Train tokenizer
tokenizer.train_from_iterator(content_iterator(dataset), trainer=trainer)

# Enforce [UNK] for OOV (correct syntax)
if "[UNK]" not in tokenizer.get_vocab():
    tokenizer.add_special_tokens(["[UNK]"])  # Add only if not present
tokenizer.unk_token_id = tokenizer.token_to_id("[UNK]")  # Set unk_token_id

# Save tokenizer
tokenizer.save("portuguese_bpe_tokenizer_cleaned.json")

# Test
test_texts = ["Olá 😊", "你好 mundo", "Olá, tudo bem? 😄"]

for text in test_texts:
    encoded = tokenizer.encode(text)
    print(f"Text: {text}, Tokens: {encoded.tokens}")
```

---

## Explanation of Fixes

- **Correct `add_special_tokens` Call**: Changed `{"unk_token": "[UNK]"}` to `["[UNK]"]` or `{"additional_special_tokens": ["[UNK]"]}`. The list format is simpler and sufficient here since `[UNK]` is already defined during initialization.
- **Conditional Addition**: The `if "[UNK]" not in tokenizer.get_vocab()` check prevents re-adding `[UNK]` if it’s already in the vocabulary, avoiding potential conflicts.
- **Setting `unk_token_id`**: Ensures the tokenizer uses `[UNK]` for OOV tokens by explicitly setting the ID, which should resolve the issue of special characters being tokenized into byte sequences.

---

## Why the Error Occurred

- The `add_special_tokens` method expects a PyList (Python list) of token strings or a dictionary with a specific structure (e.g., `{"additional_special_tokens": [...]}`). Passing a dictionary like `{"unk_token": "[UNK]"}` directly is invalid because the method doesn’t interpret it as a valid argument for adding tokens. This mismatch caused the `TypeError`.

---

## Validation

*(No additional notes in this section.)*

---

Let me know if you need further formatting or details!

Here is your original content, converted to Markdown with all formatting and layout stripped for clarity.

---

## Run the updated code and check the output:

- Text: Olá 😊, Tokens: `["Olá", ""]`  
  or  
  `["Olá", "[UNK]"]`  
  (depending on pre-tokenizer behavior).

- Ensure emojis and Chinese characters are either filtered out (empty strings) or mapped to `[UNK]`.

- Verify the vocabulary:
```python
vocab = tokenizer.get_vocab()
print("Sample vocabulary:", list(vocab.keys())[:50])
```
  Confirm that no unexpected Unicode tokens (e.g., byte sequences for emojis) are present.

---

### Additional Adjustments

- **Handle Empty Strings**:  
  If the pre-tokenizer produces empty strings (e.g., `["Olá", ""]` for `Olá 😊`), modify `keep_portuguese_chars` to replace filtered characters with `[UNK]`:
  ```python
  def keep_portuguese_chars(text):
      return re.sub(r'[^\w\sáéíóúâêîôûãõçÀ-ÿ,.!?]', '[UNK]', text)
  ```

- **Debugging**:  
  If the issue persists, print the pre-tokenized output:
  ```python
  test_text = "Olá 😊"
  pre_tokenized = tokenizer.pre_tokenizer.pre_tokenize_str(test_text)
  print("Pre-tokenized:", pre_tokenized)
  ```

---

## Next Steps

- Test the tokenizer with various inputs containing special characters to confirm the behavior.

- If you still see unexpected tokens, share the `encoded.tokens` output or the pre-tokenized result, and I’ll refine the solution further.

## I'm trying to reset the vocab but I'm still getting tokens for unwanted characters.

See my code:

```python
from tokenizers import Tokenizer, models, pre_tokenizers, trainers

# Create iterator for content_texts
def content_iterator(dataset):
    for row in dataset:
       yield row["content_texts"]

# Initialize tokenizer
tokenizer = Tokenizer(models.BPE(unk_token="[UNK]"))
tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()
trainer = trainers.BpeTrainer(
    vocab_size=30000,
    special_tokens=["[UNK]"],
    min_frequency=2,
    show_progress=True)
%%time 
tokenizer.train_from_iterator(content_iterator(dataset), trainer=trainer)

# extract vocabulary to use it exclusively
trained_vocab = tokenizer.get_vocab()
tokenizer = Tokenizer(models.BPE(unk_token="[UNK]"))  # Reinitialize to reset
tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()

# Set the trained vocabulary explicitly
tokenizer.model = models.BPE(
    vocab=trained_vocab,
    merges=sorted(tokenizer.model.merges.items()) if hasattr(tokenizer.model, 'merges') else [],
    unk_token="[UNK]"
)

# Enforce [UNK] for OOV
tokenizer.add_special_tokens(["[UNK]"])  # Add [UNK] as a special token
tokenizer.unk_token_id = tokenizer.token_to_id("[UNK]")  # Set the unk_token_id
```

the results:
```python
for i in range(0, total_lines):
    token_ids = [(tokens_per_line * i ) + id for id in range(0,tokens_per_line)]
    line = '|'.join(f"{token_id:>{column_width}}" for token_id in token_ids)
    print(line)

tokens = [tokenizer.decode([token_id]) for token_id in token_ids]
line = '|'.join(f"{token:>{column_width}}" for token in tokens)
print(line, "\n")
```

...

## Thank you for sharing your updated code and the output showing unwanted tokens

(e.g., Japanese characters like `"ロ"`, `"ン"`, `"一"`, etc).  
The issue persists despite resetting the vocabulary because the tokenizer is still capable of generating byte-level representations for any Unicode input, even when you reinitialize it with the trained vocabulary. This behavior is inherent to the `tokenizers` library's BPE implementation, which can fall back to byte-level tokenization for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) characters unless explicitly constrained.

Since your training data contains only Portuguese text and no special characters, these unwanted tokens (e.g., Japanese or other Unicode characters) are likely being generated during decoding when testing with a range of token IDs that include values not mapped to your trained vocabulary.

Let’s analyze the problem and provide a solution to exclude these unwanted characters from the token set.

---

### Why This Is Happening

1. **Byte-Level Fallback**:  
   - The `models.BPE` implementation in the `tokenizers` library supports byte-level tokenization by default.  
   - Even after reinitializing the tokenizer with `trained_vocab`, the decoder can still interpret token IDs as byte sequences for any Unicode character if those IDs fall outside the trained vocabulary’s range.  
   - This is why decoding token IDs like `560` to `579` produces Japanese characters—they correspond to byte values or pre-defined mappings in the UTF-8 space.

2. **Vocabulary Range**:  
   - Your `trained_vocab` contains only the 30,000 tokens learned from your Portuguese dataset, but the tokenizer’s internal ID space might extend beyond this range.  
   - When you decode token IDs (e.g., `560` to `579`) that aren’t explicitly mapped in `trained_vocab`, the decoder falls back to interpreting them as byte-level representations of Unicode characters.

3. **Decoding Behavior**:  
   - The `tokenizer.decode([token_id])` method attempts to convert a token ID back to a string.  
   - If the ID isn’t in the trained vocabulary, it may use a default byte-to-character mapping (e.g., UTF-8 decoding), resulting in characters like `"ロ"` or `"一"` instead of `[UNK]`.

## Pre-Tokenizer Limitation

- The `pre_tokenizers.Whitespace()` pre-tokenizer doesn’t filter out or prevent the tokenizer from handling Unicode input during inference. It only affects the pre-tokenization step during training and encoding, not the decoding process.

---

## How to Exclude Unwanted Characters

To prevent the tokenizer from generating tokens for unwanted characters (e.g., Japanese, emojis, etc.) and ensure it only uses the trained Portuguese vocabulary, you need to:

- Restrict the decoder to the trained vocabulary.
- Enforce `[UNK]` for any OOV token IDs during decoding.
- Avoid decoding token IDs outside the trained vocabulary range.

Here’s how to fix this:

---

### 1. Restrict Decoding to Trained Vocabulary

Modify the decoding process to check if a token ID is within the trained vocabulary before decoding. If it’s not, return `[UNK]`:

```python
def safe_decode(tokenizer, token_id):
    vocab = tokenizer.get_vocab()
    return tokenizer.decode([token_id]) if token_id in vocab else "[UNK]"

# Test decoding
total_lines = 10  # Adjust based on your needs
tokens_per_line = 20
column_width = 6

for i in range(0, total_lines):
    token_ids = [(tokens_per_line * i) + id for id in range(0, tokens_per_line)]
    line = '|'.join(f"{token_id:>{column_width}}" for token_id in token_ids)
    print(line)
    
    tokens = [safe_decode(tokenizer, token_id) for token_id in token_ids]
    line = '|'.join(f"{token:>{column_width}}" for token in tokens)
    print(line, "\n")
```

**Explanation:**  
The `safe_decode` function checks if the `token_id` exists in `trained_vocab`. If not, it returns `[UNK]`, preventing the generation of unwanted Unicode characters.

---

### 2. Set a Valid ID Range

Determine the range of token IDs in your trained vocabulary and only decode within that range. The `get_vocab()` method returns a dictionary where keys are token strings and values are IDs. The maximum ID can be found using `max(trained_vocab.values())`:

```python
trained_vocab = tokenizer.get_vocab()
max_id = max(trained_vocab.values())
print(f"Maximum trained token ID: {max_id}")

# Decode only within the trained range
for i in range(0, total_lines):
    token_ids = [(tokens_per_line * i) + id for id in range(0, tokens_per_line)
                 if (tokens_per_line * i) + id <= max_id]
    if not token_ids:
        break
    line = '|'.join(f"{token_id:>{column_width}}" for token_id in token_ids)
    print(line)
    
    tokens = [tokenizer.decode([token_id]) for token_id in token_ids]
    line = '|'.join(f"{token:>{column_width}}" for token in tokens)
    print(line, "\n")
```

**Explanation:**  
This limits the `token_ids` to the range of your trained vocabulary (e.g., 0 to `max_id`), avoiding IDs that trigger byte-level decoding of unwanted characters.

---

### 3. Enforce `[UNK]` in the Model

Ensure the BPE model is configured to reject OOV token IDs during decoding by setting a strict vocabulary and `unk_token_id`:

```python
# After setting the trained vocabulary
tokenizer.model = models.BPE(
    vocab=trained_vocab,
    merges=sorted(tokenizer.model.merges.items()) if hasattr(tokenizer.model, 'merges') else [],
    unk_token="[UNK]"
)
tokenizer.unk_token_id = tokenizer.token_to_id("[UNK]")

# Override decode method to enforce [UNK] for OOV
def custom_decode(self, ids):
    tokens = []
    for id_ in ids:
        token = self.decode([id_]) if id_ in self.get_vocab() else "[UNK]"
        tokens.append(token)
    return "".join(tokens)

tokenizer.decode = lambda ids: custom_decode(tokenizer, ids)  # Monkey patch the decode method
```

**Explanation:**  
This custom `decode` method ensures that any token ID not in `trained_vocab` is mapped to `[UNK]`, overriding the default byte-level fallback.

---

### 4. Updated Full Code

Here’s the complete updated code incorporating the above fixes:

```python
from tokenizers import Tokenizer, models, pre_tokenizers, trainers

# Create iterator for content_texts
def content_iterator(dataset):
    # Implementation here
    pass

# Your tokenizer training, restriction and decoding logic here...
# See code snippets above for guidance

    line = '|'.join(f"{token:>{column_width}}" for token in tokens)
    print(line, "\n")
```

---

### Expected Output

The output should now show `[UNK]` for token IDs outside the trained vocabulary (e.g., 560 to 579), instead of Japanese characters. For example:

```
560|   561|   562|   563|   564|   565|   566|   567|   568|   569|   570|   571|   572|   573|   574|   575|   576|   577|   578|   579
[UNK]|[UNK]|[UNK]|[UNK]|[UNK]|[UNK]|[UNK]|[UNK]|[UNK]|[UNK]|[UNK]|[UNK]|[UNK]|[UNK]|[UNK]|[UNK]|[UNK]|[UNK]|[UNK]|[UNK]
```

---

### Validation

Check the maximum trained token ID:

```python
max_id = max(trained_vocab.values())
print(f"Maximum trained token ID: {max_id}")
```

Ensure your `token_ids` range doesn’t exceed this value unless you want `[UNK]`.

Test with specific OOV token IDs:

```python
print(tokenizer.decode([560]))  # Should print "[UNK]"
```

---

### Additional Considerations

- **Vocabulary Size**:  
  Your `vocab_size=30000` limits the number of tokens, but the ID space might still include higher values due to special tokens or internal mappings. The custom `decode` method addresses this.

- **Performance**:  
  Monkey-patching `decode` is a workaround. For a production setting, consider creating a custom `Tokenizer` subclass to enforce this behavior permanently.

- **Debugging**:  
  If unwanted tokens persist, print the `trained_vocab` keys to confirm the vocabulary contents:

    ```python
    print("Trained vocab sample:", list(trained_vocab.keys())[:50])
    ```

---

### Next Steps

- Run the updated code and verify the output.
- If the issue persists, share the `max_id` value or the full range of `token_ids` being tested, and I’ll refine the solution further.

Here is your conversation, converted into Markdown:

---

this solution will prevent these characters to appear in the output, however, it is still wasting tokens in the vocabulary. I want to avoid wasting tokens with this characters.

---

I understand your concern—while the previous solution prevents unwanted characters (e.g., Japanese, emojis, Chinese characters) from appearing in the output by mapping them to `[UNK]`, it doesn’t address the underlying issue of "wasting" tokens in the vocabulary. The problem arises because the BPE training process might still allocate some of the 30,000 vocabulary slots to represent byte-level sequences or rare characters that could include potential Unicode characters, even if they weren’t explicitly present in your Portuguese training data. This happens due to the way BPE initializes its vocabulary and merges pairs, which can inadvertently include byte representations that could later decode to unwanted characters.

To avoid wasting tokens on these characters and ensure the vocabulary is fully optimized for your Portuguese data, we need to constrain the initial token set and the merging process to exclude non-Portuguese Unicode characters from the outset. Here’s how we can achieve this:

### Why Tokens Are Wasted

- **Byte-Level Initialization:** The `models.BPE` implementation starts with a base vocabulary that can include all 256 possible byte values (0-255) if not restricted. During training, BPE merges frequent pairs, but if your dataset is small or lacks repetition, some of these initial byte tokens might persist in the vocabulary, potentially mapping to Unicode characters (e.g., via UTF-8 decoding) that aren’t relevant to Portuguese.
- **Merging Behavior:** The `min_frequency` and `vocab_size` settings influence which pairs are merged. If non-Portuguese character sequences (e.g., from noise or edge cases) appear even minimally, they might consume vocabulary slots unless filtered.
- **Decoder Flexibility:** Even with a trained vocabulary, the decoder can interpret unused token IDs as byte sequences, but the real "waste" occurs if the vocabulary itself contains tokens that could decode to unwanted characters.

---

### Solution: Constrain the Vocabulary from the Start

To prevent wasting tokens on unwanted characters, we need to:

1. **Filter the Initial Token Set:** Limit the initial vocabulary to only Portuguese-relevant characters (Latin alphabet with accents, numbers, and punctuation) before training.
2. **Customize the Pre-Tokenizer:** Ensure the pre-tokenizer excludes non-Portuguese characters during both training and inference.
3. **Validate the Trained Vocabulary:** Confirm that the final vocabulary contains only intended tokens.

---

#### 1. Define a Custom Initial Vocabulary

Instead of letting BPE start with all possible bytes, initialize it with a controlled set of characters relevant to Portuguese. This reduces the chance of unwanted Unicode characters being included in the vocabulary.

Example initial character set for Portuguese:

```python
initial_chars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZáéíóúâêîôûãõçÀ-ÿ0123456789 ,.!?"
initial_vocab = {char: idx for idx, char in enumerate(initial_chars)}
```

---

#### 2. Use a Custom Pre-Tokenizer

Update the pre-tokenizer to filter out non-Portuguese characters during training, ensuring the BPE algorithm only processes relevant text.

---

#### 3. Retrain the Tokenizer

Train the tokenizer with these constraints to build a vocabulary that excludes unwanted characters.

Here’s the updated code:

```python
from tokenizers import Tokenizer, models, pre_tokenizers, trainers
from datasets import load_dataset
import re

# Load and preprocess dataset
dataset = load_dataset(
    "json", 
    data_files={"train": "path/to/train.json"}, 
    split="train"
)

def extract_content(example):
    content_texts = [
        conv["content"] 
        for conv in example["conversations"] 
        if "content" in conv
    ]
    return {"content_texts": content_texts}

dataset = dataset.map(extract_content)
dataset = dataset.shuffle(seed=42).select(range(5000))

# Create iterator
def content_iterator(dataset):
    for row in dataset:
        content_block = " ".join(row["content_texts"])
        yield content_block

# Define custom initial vocabulary for Portuguese
initial_chars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZáéíóúâêîôûãõçÀ-ÿ0123456789 ,.!?"
initial_vocab = {char: idx for idx, char in enumerate(initial_chars)}
initial_merges = []  # Start with no merges, let BPE build them

# Initialize tokenizer with custom pre-tokenizer
tokenizer = Tokenizer(models.BPE(
    vocab=initial_vocab,
    merges=initial_merges,
    unk_token="[UNK]"
))

def keep_portuguese_chars(text):
    return re.sub(r'[^\w\sáéíóúâêîôûãõçÀ-ÿ,.!?]', '', text)

tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.PreTokenizerCustom(keep_portuguese_chars)

# Define trainer
trainer = trainers.BpeTrainer(
    vocab_size=30000,
    special_tokens=["[UNK]"],
    min_frequency=2,
    show_progress=True
)

# Train tokenizer
%time
tokenizer.train_from_iterator(content_iterator(dataset), trainer=trainer)

# Enforce [UNK] for OOV
if "[UNK]" not in tokenizer.get_vocab():
    tokenizer.add_special_tokens(["[UNK]"])
tokenizer.unk_token_id = tokenizer.token_to_id("[UNK]")

# Save tokenizer
tokenizer.save("portuguese_bpe_tokenizer_optimized.json")

# Validate vocabulary
trained_vocab = tokenizer.get_vocab()
print("Sample vocabulary:", list(trained_vocab.keys())[:50])
print("Vocabulary size:", len(trained_vocab))

# Test decoding
total_lines = 10
tokens_per_line = 20
column_width = 6

for i in range(0, total_lines):
    token_ids = [
        (tokens_per_line * i) + id
        for id in range(0, tokens_per_line)
        if (tokens_per_line * i) + id < len(trained_vocab)
    ]
    if not token_ids:
        break
    line = '|'.join(f"{token_id:>{column_width}}" for token_id in token_ids)
    print(line)
    
    tokens = [tokenizer.decode([token_id]) for token_id in token_ids]
    line = '|'.join(f"{token:>{column_width}}" for token in tokens)
```

---

**Result:**  
By initializing the vocabulary and BPE merges only with Portuguese-relevant characters and filtering non-Portuguese ones during pre-tokenization, you ensure that no tokens in your vocab are wasted on unwanted Unicode or byte characters. The `[UNK]` token will handle edge-case OOVs during inference.

## Explanation of Changes

1. **Custom Initial Vocabulary**
   - `initial_vocab` is defined with only Portuguese-relevant characters (Latin alphabet, accents, numbers, and basic punctuation). This replaces the default byte-level start (0-255), ensuring the vocabulary begins with a controlled set of tokens.
   - `initial_merges` is empty, allowing BPE to build merges based on your dataset.

2. **Custom Pre-Tokenizer**
   - `keep_portuguese_chars` filters out non-Portuguese characters during training and inference, preventing the tokenizer from processing unwanted Unicode input.

3. **Vocabulary Constraint**
   - The `vocab_size=30000` now applies to merges starting from the `initial_vocab`, maximizing the use of slots for Portuguese subwords (e.g., `"ção"`, `"est"`) rather than byte sequences for other characters.

4. **Decoding Range**
   - The `token_ids` are limited to the `len(trained_vocab)` to avoid decoding unused IDs that might trigger byte-level fallback.

---

## Expected Outcome

- The vocabulary will contain only tokens derived from your Portuguese data, starting with the `initial_vocab` characters and extending to subword units via BPE merges.
- Decoding token IDs outside the trained vocabulary (e.g., `560` to `579`) will either be excluded (due to the range limit) or map to `[UNK]` if they fall within the ID space but aren’t in `trained_vocab`.
- Sample output should look like:

```
0  |   1  |   2  |   3  |   4  |   5  |   6  |   7  |   8  |   9  |  10 |  11 |  12 |  13 |  14 |  15 |  16 |  17 |  18 |  19
a  |   b  |   c  |   d  |   e  |   f  |   g  |   h  |   i  |   j  |  k  |  l  |  m  |  n  |  o  |  p  |  q  |  r  |  s  |  t
```
(Followed by Portuguese subwords like `"ção"`, `"est"`, etc., instead of Japanese characters.)

---

## Validation

- **Check Vocabulary:** Ensure no unwanted characters appear:

```python
unwanted_chars = set("ロンー㎖㎠㎡一万下不世业东个中串为之乐也")
vocab_keys = set(trained_vocab.keys())
print("Unwanted characters in vocab:", unwanted_chars & vocab_keys)
```
This should return an empty set.

- **Test with OOV Input:** Confirm special characters are handled:

```python
test_text = "Olá 😊 你好"
encoded = tokenizer.encode(test_text)
print("Tokens:", encoded.tokens)  # Should show ["Olá", ""] or ["Olá", "[UNK]"]
```

---

## Additional Optimizations

- **Adjust `min_frequency`:** If the vocabulary still includes rare tokens, lower `min_frequency` to 1 or increase the dataset size to encourage more merges.
- **Expand `initial_chars`:** If your data includes additional valid characters (e.g., `"@"` for emails), add them to `initial_chars`.
- **Monitor Vocabulary Usage:** Compare `len(trained_vocab)` to `vocab_size` to ensure most slots are used for meaningful subwords.

---

## If the Issue Persists

- The unwanted tokens might be from a pre-trained model or library default leaking into the process. Ensure no pre-trained tokenizer (e.g., GPT-2) is inadvertently loaded.
- Share the full `trained_vocab.keys()` list or the output of the validation step, and I’ll investigate further.

## Error

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[20], line 4
      1 def keep_portuguese_chars(text):

----> 4 tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.PreTokenizerCustom(keep_portuguese_chars)
```

The error  
`AttributeError: module 'tokenizers.pre_tokenizers' has no attribute 'PreTokenizerCustom'`  
indicates that the `tokenizers.pre_tokenizers` module does not contain a `PreTokenizerCustom` class or function.

This is likely because the `PreTokenizerCustom` class is not a standard part of the Hugging Face `tokenizers` library's public API, or the syntax has changed in the version you're using. The `tokenizers` library provides pre-built pre-tokenizers (e.g., `Whitespace`, `ByteLevel`, ...).

---

Let me know if you want a code example of how to implement a custom pre-tokenizer using the available API!

Here is your content converted from HTML to Markdown:

ByteLevel, Punctuation), but creating a custom pre-tokenizer requires a different approach, such as using the pre_tokenizers.Sequence or implementing a custom pre-tokenization logic via a different method.

## Cause of the Error

- In the Hugging Face tokenizers library (as of the latest versions, including those compatible with your setup on August 20, 2025), the PreTokenizerCustom class does not exist. The library expects you to use existing pre-tokenizers or extend the functionality through the pre_tokenizers module by combining them or using a Regex pre-tokenizer for custom patterns.
- The code attempted to use PreTokenizerCustom as a way to apply a custom function (keep_portuguese_chars), but this is not the correct way to define a custom pre-tokenizer.

## Solution

To filter out non-Portuguese characters (e.g., emojis, Chinese characters) and ensure the tokenizer only processes Portuguese-relevant text, you can use the pre_tokenizers.Regex class, which allows you to define a regular expression to split or transform text. This will replace the invalid PreTokenizerCustom usage.

## Updated Approach

- Use pre_tokenizers.Regex with a pattern that keeps only Portuguese characters and replaces others with an empty string or a delimiter.
- Alternatively, preprocess the data before feeding it to the tokenizer to remove unwanted characters, but since you want to handle this at the pre-tokenization level, the Regex approach is more integrated.

Here’s the corrected code:

```python
from tokenizers import Tokenizer, models, pre_tokenizers, trainers
from datasets import load_dataset
import re

# Load and preprocess dataset
dataset = load_dataset("json", data_files={"train": "path/to/train.json"}, split="train")

print("Vocabulary size:", len(trained_vocab))

# Test decoding

column_width = 6

for i in range(0, total_lines):
    token_ids = [(tokens_per_line * i) + id for id in range(0, tokens_per_line)
                 if (tokens_per_line * i) + id < len(trained_vocab)]
    if not token_ids:
        break
    line = '|'.join(f"{token_id:>{column_width}}" for token_id in token_ids)
    print(line)
    
    tokens = [tokenizer.decode([token_id]) for token_id in token_ids]
    line = '|'.join(f"{token:>{column_width}}" for token in tokens)
    print(line, "\n")
```

## Explanation of Changes

1. **Replace PreTokenizerCustom with Regex:**
    - The pre_tokenizers.Regex class takes a regular expression pattern that defines how to split or transform the text. The pattern r'[^\w\sáéíóúâêîôûãõçÀ-ÿ,.!?]+' matches one or more characters that are not in the Portuguese character set (Latin letters, accents, numbers, and basic punctuation) and splits the text around these matches. This effectively removes non-Portuguese characters by treating them as boundaries, preventing them from being tokenized.
    - Note: The Regex pre-tokenizer splits on the matched pattern, so non-Portuguese characters will be excluded from the tokenization process rather than preserved as tokens.

2. **Impact on Training:**
    - Since your training data is already clean (no special characters), the Regex pre-tokenizer ensures that any accidental non-Portuguese characters (e.g., from noise) are filtered out during training, keeping the vocabulary focused on Portuguese subwords.

3. **Decoding Behavior:**
    - The decoding is still limited to the trained vocabulary range (len(trained_vocab)), and any OOV token IDs will either be excluded or map to [UNK] due to the unk_token_id setting.

## Expected Output

- The vocabulary should contain only Portuguese-relevant tokens (e.g., "a", "b", "ção", "est", etc.), with no Japanese or other unwanted characters.
- Example output:

```
0  |   1  |   2  |   3  |   4  |   5  |   6  |   7  |   8  |   9  |  10 |  11 |  12 |  13 |  14 |  15 |  16 |  17 |  18 |  19
a  |   b  |   c  |   d  |   e  |   f  |   g  |   h  |   i  |   j  |  k  |  l  |  m  |  n  |  o  |  p  |  q  |  r
```

```

Testing with `Olá 😊` should result in `["Olá", ""]` (since 😊 is filtered out), or you can adjust the Regex to split differently.

---

## Adjustments

- **Refine the Regex Pattern**: If you want to preserve the structure and map non-Portuguese characters to `[UNK]` instead of removing them, use a pattern that replaces them:

```python
tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.Regex(
    r'([^\w\sáéíóúâêîôûãõçÀ-ÿ,.!?]+)', 
    replacement="[UNK]"
)
```

- This captures non-Portuguese character sequences and replaces them with `[UNK]`, which will be tokenized as the special token if it’s in the vocabulary.

- **Validate Pre-Tokenization**:
```python
test_text = "Olá 😊 你好"
pre_tokenized = tokenizer.pre_tokenizer.pre_tokenize_str(test_text)
print("Pre-tokenized:", pre_tokenized)
```

Ensure the output reflects the desired filtering (e.g., `["Olá", "", ""]` or `["Olá", "[UNK]", ""]`).

---

## Validation

- Check the vocabulary for unwanted characters:
```python
unwanted_chars = set("ロンー㎖㎠㎡一万下不世业东个中串为之乐也")
vocab_keys = set(trained_vocab.keys())
print("Unwanted characters in vocab:", unwanted_chars & vocab_keys)
```
This should return an empty set.

- Confirm the vocabulary size matches your intent (e.g., close to 30,000 with meaningful subwords).

---

## If the Issue Persists

- The unwanted tokens might be from the initial `initial_vocab` or merges including edge cases. Expand the `initial_chars` to include all possible Portuguese variations and re-train.
- Share the `pre_tokenized` output or the full `trained_vocab.keys()` list for further debugging.

AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

      3 # The Regex pattern matches any character not in the Portuguese set and replaces it with a split
AttributeError: module 'tokenizers.pre_tokenizers' has no attribute 'Regex'
```

---

## Why This Error Occurs

The error `AttributeError: module 'tokenizers.pre_tokenizers' has no attribute 'Regex'` indicates that the `tokenizers.pre_tokenizers` module does not have a `Regex` class or function in the version of the `tokenizers` library you're using. This suggests that the approach to using a regular expression-based pre-tokenizer via `pre_tokenizers.Regex` is either outdated, misnamed, or not directly supported.

The Hugging Face `tokenizers` library provides pre-built pre-tokenizers (e.g., `Whitespace`, `ByteLevel`, `Punctuation`), but a direct `Regex` pre-tokenizer might not be available.

---

### Cause of the Error

- The `tokenizers.pre_tokenizers` module includes pre-defined pre-tokenizers like `Whitespace`, `ByteLevel`, and `Punctuation`, but not `Regex`. 
- The intended use of a regex pattern to filter non-Portuguese characters was based on an assumption that a `Regex` pre-tokenizer exists, but this needs adjustment.

---

## Solution

To filter out non-Portuguese characters (e.g., emojis, Chinese characters) and ensure the tokenizer only processes Portuguese-relevant text, you can use one of the following approaches:

1. **Use `pre_tokenizers.Split` with a Custom Pattern**  
   The `pre_tokenizers.Split` class allows you to split text based on a regular expression pattern. Use it to split on non-Portuguese characters, effectively filtering them out.

2. **Preprocess Data Before Tokenization**  
   Apply your `keep_portuguese_chars` function to the data before feeding it to the iterator, ensuring the tokenizer only sees cleaned text.

3. **Combine Pre-Tokenizers**  
   Use `pre_tokenizers.Sequence` to combine `Whitespace` with a custom split to handle non-Portuguese characters.

---

The most integrated solution is to use `pre_tokenizers.Split` with a regex pattern. Here’s the corrected code:

```python
from tokenizers import Tokenizer, models, pre_tokenizers, trainers
from datasets import load_dataset
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Replace Regex with Split**:
    - The `pre_tokenizers.Split` class is used with a regular expression pattern `r'[^\w\sáéíóúâêîôûãõçÀ-ÿ,.!?]+'` to split the text. The `behavior='removed'` argument ensures that the matched non-Portuguese characters (e.g., emojis, Chinese characters) are removed rather than preserved as separate tokens.
    - This pre-tokenizer will split the text into segments of Portuguese-relevant characters, discarding the unwanted parts during both training and inference.

2. **Impact on Training**:
    - The tokenizer will only build its vocabulary and merges based on the filtered text, ensuring that the 30,000 vocabulary slots are used for Portuguese subwords (e.g., `"ção"`, `"est"`) rather than byte sequences for unwanted characters.

3. **Decoding Behavior**:
    - The decoding is still limited to the trained vocabulary range (`len(trained_vocab)`), and any OOV token IDs will be excluded or handled by the `unk_token_id` setting.

---

### Expected Output

- The vocabulary should contain only Portuguese-relevant tokens starting from the `initial_vocab` and extending to subword units.
- Example output:
    ```
    0  |   1  |   2  |   3  |   4  |   5  |   6  |   7  |   8  |   9  |  10 |  11 |  12 |  13 |  14 |  15 |  16 |  17 |  18 |  19
    a  |   b  |   c  |   d  |   e  |   f  |   g  |   h  |   i  |   j  |  k  |  l  |  m  |  n  |  o  |  p  |  q  |  r  |  s  |  t
    ```
- Testing with `Olá 😊` should result in `["Olá"]` (since 😊 is removed), avoiding wasted tokens.

---

### Adjustments

- **Alternative Behavior**: If you want to replace non-Portuguese characters with `[UNK]` instead of removing them, use `behavior='isolated'` and adjust the pattern:

    ```python
    tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = pre_tokenizers.Split(
        pattern=r'([^\w\sáéíóúâêîôûãõçÀ-ÿ,.!?]+)',  # Capture non-Portuguese characters
        behavior='isolated',  # Treat matches as separate tokens
        invert=False  # Do not invert the pattern
    )
    ```
    Then, post-process to map these to `[UNK]` (though this might require additional custom logic, as Split doesn’t directly support replacements).

- **Validate Pre-Tokenization**:

    ```python
    test_text = "Olá 😊 你好"
    pre_tokenized = tokenizer.pre_tokenizer.pre_tokenize_str(test_text)
    print("Pre-tokenized:", pre_tokenized)  # Should show [("Olá", (0, 4))]
    ```

## Validation

- Check the vocabulary for unwanted characters:

  ```python
  unwanted_chars = set("ロンー㎖㎠㎡一万下不世业东个中串为之乐也")
  vocab_keys = set(trained_vocab.keys())
  print("Unwanted characters in vocab:", unwanted_chars & vocab_keys)
  ```

  This should return an empty set.

- Confirm the vocabulary size is close to 30,000 with meaningful subwords.

---

## If the Issue Persists

- The `Split` pre-tokenizer might not fully prevent byte-level fallback during decoding. In that case, combine it with the custom `decode` method from the previous solution:

  ```python
  def custom_decode(self, ids):
      tokens = []
      for id_ in ids:
          token = self.decode([id_]) if id_ in self.get_vocab() else "[UNK]"
          tokens.append(token)
      return "".join(tokens)

  tokenizer.decode = lambda ids: custom_decode(tokenizer, ids)
  ```

- Share the `pre_tokenized` output or the full `trained_vocab.keys()` list for further debugging.
